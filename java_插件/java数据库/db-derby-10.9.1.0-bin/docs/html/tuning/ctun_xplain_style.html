<h1 class="topictitle1">How you use the XPLAIN style</h1>


<div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        XPLAIN style is an enhanced form of RUNTIMESTATISTICS processing
        which preserves captured statistics information in 
        <a href="ctun_xplain_tables.html#ctun_xplain_tables">database 
            tables</a>.
        Once the statistics have been collected and saved in the 
        tables, they can be queried for analysis purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that <span>Derby</span>
        spells XPLAIN without the initial 'E'. This is done
        to help distinguish the
        <span>Derby</span>
        functionality from the explain
        functionality that you might be familiar with from commercial DBMS
        products. The current XPLAIN implementation is optimized for
        ad-hoc queries and tool support. Furthermore, the explain data
        is quite extensive to analyze. 
        <span>Derby</span>
        tries to implement a
        compromise between detailed explain information which is
        almost unreadable by human users and which has to be evaluated
        with the help of a tool, versus a compact version of explain
        data which is only applicable for rough investigations but
        is still browseable by human users. We feel that the information
        in the XPLAIN system tables is sufficiently detailed to be powerful,
        but still simple enough to provide useful information to
        ad-hoc querying during interactive use.
    </p>

    <p>
    To use XPLAIN style, first turn on RUNTIMESTATISTICS using the
            <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS()</samp> system
            procedure.</p>

        <p>Optionally, turn on statistics timing using the
            <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_STATISTICS_TIMING</samp>
            system procedure.  If you do not turn on statistics timing,
            you will see the statement execution
            plan only, and not the timing information.</p>

        <p>Next, to activate XPLAIN style, use the
            <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA()</samp> system
        procedure:</p>

<pre>-- turn on RUNTIMESTATISTICS for connection:
<strong>CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS(1);</strong>
<strong>CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_STATISTICS_TIMING(1);</strong>
-- Indicate that statistics information should be captured into
-- database tables in the MYSCHEMA schema:
<strong>CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA('MYSCHEMA');</strong>
--execute queries, step through result sets, perform application processing...
<strong>CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS(0);</strong></pre>

<p>Although the syntax is different, the basic steps for working with
    XPLAIN style are the same in a Java program.</p>

<p>XPLAIN style is further refined by the use of XPLAIN-only mode. By
    default, XPLAIN-only mode is off, which means that statements are
    compiled and executed normally. When XPLAIN-only mode is on, statements
    are compiled, but not executed. This is useful for investigating what
    query plan has been selected for a statement, without actually
    executing the statement. To activate XPLAIN-only mode, use the
    <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_MODE()</samp> system procedure:</p>

<pre>
    call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_MODE(1);
</pre>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Examples</h2><p>Some examples of usage follow.</p>

    <p>Retrieve the text of statements
        which were captured, in order by the time when the statistics were
    captured:</p>

<pre>
    select stmt_text, xplain_time from myschema.sysxplain_statements
    order by xplain_time
</pre>

<p>Retrieve the text of statements which were captured, showing the
    statements which took the longest time to execute first:</p>

<pre>
    select s.stmt_text, st.execute_time from myschema.sysxplain_statements s,
           myschema.sysxplain_statement_timings st
    where s.timing_id = st.timing_id
    order by st.execute_time desc
</pre>

<p>Show the statements that were executed, together with the result sets
    that each statement required:</p>

<pre>
    select st.stmt_text, rs.op_identifier 
    from myschema.sysxplain_statements st
    join myschema.sysxplain_resultsets rs
         on st.stmt_id = rs.stmt_id
</pre>

<p>Find statements which resulted in an external sort being performed:</p>

<pre>
    select s.stmt_text, s.stmt_id, rs.op_identifier, srt.no_input_rows
    from myschema.sysxplain_sort_props srt,
         myschema.sysxplain_resultsets rs,
         myschema.sysxplain_statements s
    where rs.stmt_id = s.stmt_id and rs.sort_rs_id = srt.sort_rs_id
          and srt.sort_type = 'EX'
</pre>

<p>Show statements which resulted in a sort, sorted by the number of
    rows which were sorted by that statement.</p>

<pre>
    select s.stmt_text, s.stmt_id, rs.op_identifier, srt.no_input_rows
    from myschema.sysxplain_sort_props srt,
         myschema.sysxplain_resultsets rs,
         myschema.sysxplain_statements s
    where rs.stmt_id = s.stmt_id and rs.sort_rs_id = srt.sort_rs_id
    order by srt.no_input_rows desc
</pre>

<p>Find statements which resulted in a tablescan of the COUNTRIES table,
    and display the number of pages and rows that were visited by each scan:</p>

<pre>
    select st.stmt_text, sp.no_visited_pages, sp.no_visited_rows 
    from myschema.sysxplain_scan_props sp, 
         myschema.sysxplain_resultsets rs, 
         myschema.sysxplain_statements st 
    where st.stmt_id = rs.stmt_id and 
          rs.scan_rs_id = sp.scan_rs_id and 
          rs.op_identifier = 'TABLESCAN' and 
          sp.scan_object_name = 'COUNTRIES'
</pre>
