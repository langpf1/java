<h1 class="topictitle1">Using the statement cache</h1>


<div>
<div class="p">The statement cache is enabled by default. You can use it to avoid extra
compilation overhead:   <ul>
<li>Your application can use <em>PreparedStatements</em> instead of <em>Statements</em>.
  <p><em>PreparedStatements</em> are JDBC objects that you prepare (compile)
once and execute multiple times. See the figure below. If your application
executes statements that are almost but not exactly alike, use <em>PreparedStatements</em>,
which can contain dynamic or IN parameters. Instead of using the literals
for changing parameters, use question marks (?) as placeholders for such parameters.
Provide the values when you execute the statement.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p><span>Derby</span> supports the
<em>ParameterMetaData</em> interface. This interface describes the number, type, and properties
of prepared statement parameters. See the <cite><span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span></cite> for
more information.</p>

<p>A connection need only compile a <em>PreparedStatement</em> once. Subsequent
executions can use the same statement execution plan even if the parameter
values are different, as shown in the following figure.
(<em>PreparedStatements</em> are not shared across connections.)</p>

<div class="fignone" id="ctundepth32379__ctundepth42475"><a name="ctundepth32379__ctundepth42475"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Prepared statements and the
statement cache</span>
<br /><img src="pstmt_os.gif" alt="This figure shows multiple executions of the same PreparedStatement over a single connection. The single PreparedStatement object uses the same statement execution plan and statement cache." /><br />
</div>
<ul>
<li>Even if your statement uses <em>Statements</em> instead of <em>PreparedStatements</em>, <span>Derby</span> can reuse the statement
execution plan for the statements from the statement cache. Statements from
any connection can share the same statement execution plan, avoiding compilation,
by using the single-statement cache. The statement cache maintains statement
plans across connections. It does not, however, maintain them across reboots.
See the figure below. <p>When, in the same database, an application submits
an SQL <em>Statement</em> that exactly matches one already in the cache, <span>Derby</span> grabs the statement from
the cache, even if the <em>Statement</em> has already been closed by the application.</p>
 <p>To
match exactly with a statement already in the cache, the SQL <em>Statement</em> must
meet the following requirements:</p>
 <ul>
<li>The text must match exactly</li>

<li>The current schema must match</li>

<li>The Unicode flag that the statement was compiled under must match the
current connection's flag</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<div class="remember"><span class="remembertitle">Remember: </span>If your application executes statements that are almost
but not exactly alike, it is more efficient to use <em>PreparedStatements</em> with
dynamic or IN parameters.  </div>

<p>The following figure shows how
<span>Derby</span> can reuse a statement
execution plan that is already in the statement cache when the SQL text matches
a prior statement <em>exactly</em>, even when the statement is executed from a
different connection. <em>PreparedStatements</em> are much more efficient,
however.</p>

<div class="fignone" id="ctundepth32379__ctundepth12523"><a name="ctundepth32379__ctundepth12523"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 2. Statements and the statement
cache</span>
<br /><img src="stmt_os.gif" alt="This figure shows how Derby can reuse a statement execution plan that is already in the statement cache, even when the statement is executed from a different connection. The figure shows three executions of two similar statements over two different database connections. Each database connection has its own statement cache. One statement is &quot;SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id = ?&quot;. The other statement is &quot;SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id = 2&quot;. The statement that uses the dynamic parameter is executed on both Connection One and Connection Two. When it is executed the second time, on Connection Two, it can use the statement execution plan that is already in the statement cache of Connection One. The version that does not use a dynamic parameter is executed on Connection Two only and uses the statement cache for Connection Two." /><br />
</div>

<p>The <em>derby.language.statementCacheSize</em> property controls the number of
precompiled statements which
<span>Derby</span> keeps in its statement
cache. Consider raising this number if statement preparation is taking too much
time. See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for more information
on this property.</p>

<p>A multithreaded database application that frequently alternates select and
update statements can encounter deadlocks when a prepared statement becomes
invalid or outdated. If your application becomes deadlocked under these
circumstances, you can work around this problem by setting the value of the
<em>derby.language.statementCacheSize</em> property to zero.</p>
