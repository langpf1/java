<h1 class="topictitle1">Statement execution plan</h1>


<div>
<p>RUNTIMESTATISTICS also provides information about the <em>statement execution
plan</em>. The statement execution plan shows how long each node took to evaluate,
how many rows were retrieved, whether an index was used, and so on. If an
index was used, it shows the start and stop positions for the matching index
scan. Looking at the plan can help you determine whether to add an index or
to rewrite the query.</p>

<p>A statement execution plan is composed of a tree of result set nodes. A
result set node represents the evaluation of one portion of the statement;
it returns rows to a calling (or parent) node and can receive rows from a
child node. A node can have one or more children. Starting from the top, if
a node has children, it requests rows from the children. Usually only the
execution plans of DML statements (queries, inserts, updates, and deletes,
not dictionary object creation) are composed of more than one node.</p>

<div class="p">For example, consider the following query:   <pre><strong>SELECT * FROM Countries</strong></pre>
</div>

<div class="p">This simple query involves one node only-reading all the data out of the <em>Countries</em> table.
It involves a single node with no children. This result set node is called
a <em>Table Scan ResultSet</em>. RUNTIMESTATISTICS text for this node looks
something like this:   <pre>

        null

        select * from countries

</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Consider this second, more complex query:   <pre><strong><span />SELECT Country
FROM Countries
WHERE Region = 'Central America'</strong></pre>
</div>

<div class="p">When executed, this query involves two nodes- one to retrieve
qualifying rows (the restriction is done at this node) and one to project
the requested columns. So, at bottom, there is a <em>TableScanResultSet</em> for
scanning the table. The qualifier (Region = 'Central America') is evaluated
in this node. These data are passed up to the parent node, called a <em>Project-Restrict
ResultSet</em>, in which the rows are projected-only the <em>country</em> column
is needed (the first column in the table). RUNTIMESTATISTICS text for these
two nodes looks something like this:   <pre>Statement Name:
        null
Statement Text:
        SELECT Country FROM Countries WHERE Region = 'Central America'

</div>

<p>Other, more complex queries such as joins and unions have other types of
result set nodes.</p>

<p>For inserts, updates, and deletes, rows flow out of the top, where they
are inserted, updated, or deleted. For selects (queries), rows flow out of
the top into a result set that is returned to the user.</p>

<p>The <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite> shows the
many possible <em>ResultSet</em> nodes that might appear in an execution plan. </p>
