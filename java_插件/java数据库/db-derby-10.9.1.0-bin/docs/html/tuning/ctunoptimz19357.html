<h1 class="topictitle1">About the system's selection of lock granularity</h1>


<div>
<div class="p">When a system is configured for row-level locking, it decides whether to
use table-level locking or row-level locking for each table in each DML statement.
The system bases this decision on the number of rows read or written for each
table, and on whether a full conglomerate scan is done for each table.   
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>When you have turned off row-level locking for your system, <span>Derby</span> always
uses table-level locking.</div>
</div>

<div class="p">The first goal of the system's decision is concurrency; wherever possible,
the system chooses row-level locking. However, row-level locking uses a lot
of resources and might have a negative impact on performance. Sometimes row-level
locking does not provide much more concurrency than table-level locking. In
those situations, the system might choose to escalate the locking scheme from
row-level locking to table-level locking to improve performance. For example,
if a connection is configured for TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE isolation, the
system chooses table-level locking for the following statement:  
<pre><strong>SELECT *
FROM FlightAvailability AS fa, Flights AS fts
WHERE fts.flight_id = fa.flight_id
AND fts.segment_number = fa.segment_number</strong></pre>
</div>

<div class="p">To satisfy the isolation requirements, <span>Derby</span> would have to lock all
the rows in both the<em> FlightAvailability</em> and the <em>Flights</em> tables. Locking both the tables would be cheaper,
would provide the same isolation, and would allow the same concurrency.  
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>You can force lock escalation for specific tables when you alter
them with the LOCKSIZE clause. For these tables, <span>Derby</span> always chooses
table-level locking. For more information, see the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</div>
