<h1 class="topictitle1">Join order case study</h1>


<div>
<p>For example, consider the following situation:</p>

<p>The <em>Flights</em> table (as you know) stores information
about flight segments. It has a primary key on the <em>flight_id</em> and <em>segment_number </em>columns. This primary key
constraint is backed up by a unique index on those columns.</p>

<p>The <em>FlightAvailability</em> table, which stores information
about the availability of flight segments on particular days, can store several
rows for a particular row in the <em>Flights</em> table (one
for each date).</p>

<div class="p">You want to see information about all the flights, and you issue the following
query:  
<pre><strong>SELECT *
FROM FlightAvailability AS fa, Flights AS fts
WHERE fa.flight_id = fts.flight_id
AND fa.segment_number = fts.segment_number</strong></pre>
</div>

<p>First imagine the situation in which there are no useful indexes on the <em>FlightAvailability</em> table.</p>

<p>Using the join order with <em>FlightAvailability</em> as
the outer table and <em>Flights</em> as the inner table is
cheaper because it allows the <em>flight_id</em>/<em>segment_number</em> columns from <em>FlightAvailability</em> to
be used to probe into and find matching rows in <em>Flights,</em> using the primary key index on <em>Flights.flight_id</em> and <em>Flights.segment_number</em>.</p>

<p>This is preferable to the opposite join order (with <em>Flights</em> as the outer table and <em>FlightAvailability</em> as the inner table) because in that case, for each row in <em>Flights,</em> the system would have to scan the entire <em>FlightAvailability</em> table to find the matching rows (because there is
no useful index- an index on the <em>flight_id</em>/<em>segment_number</em> columns).</p>

<p>Second, imagine the situation in which there is a useful index on the <em>FlightAvailability</em> table (this is actually the case in
the sample database). <em>FlightAvailability</em> has a primary
key index on <em>flight_id</em>, <em>segment_number</em>, and <em>booking_date</em>. In that index, the <em>flight_id</em>-<em>segment_number</em> combination is not unique,
since there is a one-to-many correspondence between the <em>Flights</em> table and the <em>FlightAvailability</em> table.
However, the index is still very useful for finding rows with particular <em>flight_id</em>/<em>segment_number</em> values.</p>

<div class="p">You issue the same query:  
<pre><strong>SELECT *
FROM FlightAvailability AS fa, Flights AS fts
WHERE fa.flight_id = fts.flight_id
AND fa.segment_number = fts.segment_number</strong></pre>
</div>

<p>Although the difference in cost is smaller, it is still cheaper for the <em>Flights</em> table to be the inner table, because its index
is unique, whereas <em>FlightAvailability</em>'s index
is not. That is because it is cheaper for <span>Derby</span> to step through a unique
index than through a non-unique index.</p>
