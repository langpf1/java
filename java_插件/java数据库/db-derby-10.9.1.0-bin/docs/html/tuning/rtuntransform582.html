<h1 class="topictitle1">Simple IN predicate transformations</h1>



<div><p />

<div class="section"><p>A <dfn class="term">simple</dfn> IN list predicate is a predicate where the
left operand is a <a href="ctuntransform13966.html#ctuntransform13966__rtuntransform13785">simple
column reference</a> and the IN list is composed entirely of constants
or parameter markers. The following are examples of simple IN predicates:</p>
<pre>    orig_airport IN ('ABQ', 'AKL', 'DSM')

    orig_airport IN (?, ?, ?)

    orig_airport IN ('ABQ', ?, ?, 'YYZ') </pre>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Probe predicates</h2><p><span>Derby</span> transforms
each IN list predicate into an equality predicate whose right operand is a
parameter marker that is created internally. This internal equality predicate
is called a <dfn class="term">probe predicate</dfn>. Each of the above examples of simple
IN predicates is transformed into the following probe predicate:</p>
<pre>    orig_airport = ?</pre>
<p>Probe
predicates are treated differently than normal equality predicates. Probe
predicates are processed in a special way during query optimization and execution. </p>
<p>During
optimization, <span>Derby</span> analyzes
the probe predicate to determine if the probe predicate is useful for limiting
the number of rows retrieved from disk. For a probe predicate to be useful,
both of the following requirements must be true:</p>
<ol>
<li>There must be an index defined on the table that the column reference
belongs to, and the column reference must be the first column in the index.
In the example above, <samp class="codeph">orig_airport</samp> is the column reference.</li>

<li>The estimated cost of an access path that uses the probe predicate and
one of the corresponding indexes must be less than the estimated cost of any
other access paths calculated by the optimizer.  Typically, this means that
the number of values in the IN list is significantly fewer than the number
of rows in the table that the column reference belongs to.</li>

</ol>
<p>If both of these requirements are met, <span>Derby</span> will
use the probe predicate at query execution to <em>probe</em> the underlying
index for values in the IN list. In other words, the right operand of the
probe predicate (the parameter) becomes a place-holder into which <span>Derby</span> plugs
the different values from the IN list. Then for each value, <span>Derby</span> reads
the matching rows from the index.</p>
<p>If either of the two requirements
is not satisfied, <span>Derby</span> discards
the internal probe predicate and executes the query using the original IN
list predicate.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Examples</h2><p>The following query is submitted to <span>Derby</span>:</p>
<pre>SELECT flights.orig_airport, cities.city_name 
    FROM flights, cities
    WHERE flights.orig_airport IN ('ABQ', 'DSM', 'YYZ')
        AND flights.orig_airport = cities.airport   </pre>
<p>The Derby
optimizer transforms this query internally into:     </p>
<pre>SELECT flights.orig_airport, cities.city_name
    FROM flights, cities
    WHERE flights.orig_airport = ?
        AND flights.orig_airport = cities.airport   </pre>
<p>In this
transformed query <samp class="codeph">flights.orig_airport = ?</samp> is an internal
probe predicate.</p>
<p>There is an index on the <samp class="codeph">org_airport</samp> column
in the <samp class="codeph">flights</samp> table. If the estimated cost of probing that
index for the three values (ABQ, DSM, YYZ) is less than the cost of accessing
the <samp class="codeph">flights</samp> table in some other way, <span>Derby</span> will
perform probing on the index at query execution. This approach ensures that <span>Derby</span> reads only the necessary
rows from the <span>Derby</span> table.</p>
<p>At
a higher level, the approach by <span>Derby</span> to
use index probing for IN lists is an internal way of evaluating the transformed
predicate multiple times. The predicate is evaluated one time for each value
in the IN list.</p>
<div class="p">From a JDBC perspective, <span>Derby</span> is
logically (but not actually) performing the following statements and then
combining the three result sets (rs1, rs2, and rs3) : <pre>PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(
    "select flights.orig_airport, cities.city_name " +
    "from flights, cities " +
    "where flights.orig_airport = ? " +
        "and flights.orig_airport = cities.airport ");

ps.setString(1, "ABQ");
rs1 = ps.executeQuery();

ps.setString(1, "DSM");
rs2 = ps.executeQuery();

ps.setString(1, "YYZ");
rs3 = ps.executeQuery();

</pre>
</div>
<p>From an SQL perspective, <span>Derby</span> is
logically (but not actually) performing the following statement:</p>
<pre>SELECT flights.orig_airport, cities.city_name
    FROM flights, cities
    WHERE flights.orig_airport = 'ABQ'
        AND flights.orig_airport = cities.airport

UNION ALL

SELECT flights.orig_airport, cities.city_name
    FROM flights, cities
    WHERE flights.orig_airport = 'DSM'
        AND flights.orig_airport = cities.airport

UNION ALL

SELECT flights.orig_airport, cities.city_name
    FROM flights, cities
    WHERE flights.orig_airport = 'YYZ'
        AND flights.orig_airport = cities.airport
    </pre>
<p>In the above SQL example, for each subquery the equality
predicate limits the number of rows read from the <samp class="codeph">flights</samp> table
so that the process avoids having to read unnecessary rows from disk. </p>
<p>The
larger the <samp class="codeph">flights</samp> table, the more time <span>Derby</span> will
save by probing the index for the relatively few IN list values. </p>
<p>By
using probe predicates, regardless of how large the base table is, <span>Derby</span> only
has to probe the index a maximum of N times, where N is the size of the IN
list. If N is significantly less than the number of rows in the table, or
is significantly less than the number of rows between the minimum value and
the maximum value in the IN list, selective probing ensures that <span>Derby</span> does
not spend time reading unnecessary rows from disk.</p>
