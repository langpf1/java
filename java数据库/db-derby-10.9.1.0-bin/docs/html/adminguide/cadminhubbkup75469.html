<title>Using operating system commands with the freeze and unfreeze system

<h1 class="topictitle1">Using operating system commands with the freeze and unfreeze system
procedures to perform an online backup</h1>


<div>
<p>Typically, these procedures are used to speed up the copy operation involved
in an online backup. In this scenario, <span>Derby</span> does
not perform the copy operation for you. You use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_FREEZE_DATABASE
procedure to lock the database, and then you explicitly copy the database
directory by using operating system commands. </p>

<p>For example, because the UNIX tar command uses operating system file-copying
routines, and the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE procedure uses java I/O
calls with additional internal synchronization that allow updates during the
backup, the tar command might provide faster backups than the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE
procedure.</p>

<p>To use operating system commands for online database backups, call the
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_FREEZE_DATABASE system procedure. The SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_FREEZE_DATABASE
system procedure puts the database into a state in which it can be safely
copied. After the database has been copied, use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_UNFREEZE_DATABASE
system procedure to continue working with the database. Only after SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_UNFREEZE_DATABASE
has been specified can transactions once again write to the database. Read
operations can proceed while the database is "frozen."</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>To ensure a consistent backup of the database, <span>Derby</span> might
block applications that attempt to write to a frozen database until the backup
is completed and the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_UNFREEZE_DATABASE system procedure is
called.</div>

<p>The following example demonstrates how the freeze and unfreeze procedures
are used to surround an operating system copy command:</p>

<pre>public static void backUpDatabaseWithFreeze(Connection conn)
	throws SQLException
{
Statement s = conn.createStatement();
s.executeUpdate(
    "CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_FREEZE_DATABASE()");
<strong>//copy the database directory during this interval</strong>
s.executeUpdate(
    "CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_UNFREEZE_DATABASE()");
s.close();
}</pre>
