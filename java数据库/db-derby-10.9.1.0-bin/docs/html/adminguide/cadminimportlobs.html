<h1 class="topictitle1">Bulk import and export of large objects</h1>



<div><p>You can import and export large objects (LOBs) using the
<span>Derby</span> system
procedures.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Importing and exporting CLOB and BLOB data</h2>
<p>CLOB and BLOB data can be exported to the same file as the rest of the column
data, or the LOB column data can be exported to a separate external file. When
the LOB column data is exported to a separate external file, reference to the
location of the LOB data is placed in the LOB column in the main export
file.</p>

<p>Importing and exporting LOB data using a separate external file might be
faster than storing the LOB data in the same file as the rest of the column
data:</p>

<ul>
<li>The CLOB data does not have to be scanned for the delimiters inside the
data</li>

<li>The BLOB data does not need to be converted to hexadecimal format</li>

</ul>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Importing and exporting other binary data</h2>
<p>When you export columns that contain the data types CHAR FOR BIT DATA,
VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA, and LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA, the column data is always
exported to the main export file. The data is written in hexadecimal format. To
import data into a table that has columns of these data types, the data in the
import file for those columns must be in hexadecimal format.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Importing LOB data from a file that contains all of the
data</h2>
<p>You can use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_IMPORT_TABLE and
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_IMPORT_DATA procedures to import data into a table that
contains a LOB column. The LOB data must be stored in the same file as the other
column data that you are importing. If you are importing data from a file that
was exported from a non-<span>Derby</span>
source, the binary data must be in hexadecimal format.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Importing LOB data from a separate external file</h2>
<p>You can use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_IMPORT_TABLE_LOBS_FROM_EXTFILE and
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_IMPORT_DATA_LOBS_FROM_EXTFILE procedures to import LOB data
that is stored in a file that is separate from the main import file. These
procedures read the LOB data using the reference that is stored in the main
import file.  If you are importing data from a
non-<span>Derby</span> source, the
references to the LOB data must be in the main import file in the format
<span class="parmname">lobsFileName.Offset.length/</span>. This is the same method that
the <span>Derby</span> export procedures
use to export the LOB data to a separate external file.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Exporting LOB data to the same file as the other column
data</h2>
<p>You can use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE and
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_QUERY procedures to write LOB data, along with rest of
the column data, to a single export file.</p>

<p>CLOB column data is treated same as other character data. Character
delimiters are allowed inside the CLOB data. The export procedures write the
delimiter inside the data as a double-delimiter.</p>

<p>BLOB column data is written to the export file in hexadecimal format. For
each byte of BLOB data, two characters are generated. The first character
represents the high nibble (4 bits) in hexadecimal and the second character
represents the low nibble.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Exporting LOB data to a separate external file from the other
column data</h2>
<p>You can use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE_LOBS_TO_EXTFILE and
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_QUERY_LOBS_TO_EXTFILE procedures to write LOB data to a
separate external file. These procedures include the
<span class="parmname">lobFileName</span> parameter, which specifies the name of the
external file for the LOB data.</p>

<p>When you use these procedures, the location of the LOB data is written to the
main export file. The format of the  reference to the LOB stored in the main
export file is <span class="parmname">lobsFileName.Offset.length/</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="parmname">Offset</span> is the position in the external file in
bytes</li>

<li><span class="parmname">length</span> is the size of the LOB column data in
bytes</li>

</ul>

<p>If a LOB column value is NULL, length is written as -1. No data conversion
is performed when you export LOB data to an external file. BLOB data is written
in binary format, and CLOB data is written using the codeset that you
specify.</p>
