<h1 class="topictitle1">Forcing a failover</h1>


<div>
<p>At any time, you can transform the
<span>Derby</span> database that has the
slave role into a normal 
<span>Derby</span> database that can
process transactions. This transformation from being a slave to becoming an
active <span>Derby</span> database is
called <em>failover</em>. During failover, the slave applies the parts of the
transaction log that have not yet been processed. It then undoes operations that
belong to uncommitted transactions, resulting in a transaction-consistent state
that includes all transactions whose commit log record has been sent to the
slave.</p>

<p>You perform failover from the master system. To do so, you connect to the
database on the master system using
the <em>failover=true</em> connection URL attribute. For example, for a database
named <samp class="codeph">wombat</samp>, you might specify the following connection URL:
</p>

<pre>
jdbc:derby:wombat;failover=true
</pre>

<p>If the network connection between the master system and the slave system is
lost, you can perform failover from the slave system.</p>

<p>See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details about the
<em>failover=true</em> attribute.</p>

<p>There is no automatic failover or restart of replication after one of the
instances has failed.</p>
