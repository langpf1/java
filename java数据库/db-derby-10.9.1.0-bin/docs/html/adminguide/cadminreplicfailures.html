<p>Replication can encounter several failure situations. The following table
lists these situations and describes the actions that
<span>Derby</span> takes as a result.

is explicitly requested to do so by either the <em>failover=true</em> or

slave applies all received log records and boots the database as described in
<a href="cadminreplicfailover.html#cadminreplicfailover">Forcing a failover</a>. If the

<td valign="top" width="70%" headers="N10083">The master notices that the main memory log buffer is
filling up. It first tries to increase the speed of the log shipment to keep
the amount of log in the buffer below the maximum. If that is not enough to
keep the buffer from getting full, the response time of transactions may
increase for as long as log shipment has trouble keeping up with the amount of
generated log records. You can use properties to tune both the log buffer size
and the minimum and maximum interval between consecutive log shipments. See
