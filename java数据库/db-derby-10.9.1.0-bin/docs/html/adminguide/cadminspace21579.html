<h1 class="topictitle1">Reclaiming unused space</h1>



<div><p>A <span>Derby</span> table
or index (sometimes called a <em>conglomerate</em>) can contain unused space
after large amounts of data have been deleted or updated.</p>

<p>This happens because, by default, <span>Derby</span> does
not return unused space to the operating system. After a page has been allocated
to a table or index, <span>Derby</span> does
not automatically return the page to the operating system until the table
or index is dropped, even if the space is no longer needed. However, <span>Derby</span> does
provide a way to reclaim unused space in tables and associated indexes.</p>

<p>If you determine that a table and its indexes have a significant amount
of unused space, use either the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE or SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE
procedure to reclaim that space. SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE is guaranteed to recover
the maximum amount of free space, at the cost of temporarily creating new
tables and indexes before the statement is committed. SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS
attempts to reclaim space within the same table, but cannot guarantee it will
recover all available space. The difference between the two procedures is
that unlike SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE, the SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS procedure uses
no temporary files and moves rows around within the same conglomerate.</p>

<p>
You can use the SYSCS_DIAG.SPACE_TABLE diagnostic table to estimate the
amount of unused space in a table or index by examining, in particular, the
values of the NUMFREEPAGES and ESTIMSPACESAVING columns. For example:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM TABLE(SYSCS_DIAG.SPACE_TABLE('APP', 'FLIGHTAVAILABILITY')) AS T
</pre>

<p>
For more information about SYSCS_DIAG.SPACE_TABLE, see "SYSCS_DIAG
diagnostic tables and functions" in the
<cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.
</p>

<div class="example"><p>As an example, after you have determined that the FlightAvailability
table and its related indexes have too much unused space, you could reclaim
that space with the following command:</p>
<pre>call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP', 'FLIGHTAVAILABILITY', 0);</pre>
<p> The
third parameter in the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE() procedure determines
whether the operation will run in sequential or non-sequential mode. If you
specify <samp class="codeph">0</samp> for the third argument in the procedure, the operation
will run in non-sequential mode. In sequential mode,<span>Derby</span> compresses
the table and indexes sequentially, one at a time. Sequential compression
uses less memory and disk space but is slower. To force the operation to run
in sequential mode, substitute a non-zero SMALLINT value for the third argument.
The following example shows how to force the procedure to run in sequential
mode:</p>
<pre>call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP', 'FLIGHTAVAILABILITY', 1);</pre>
