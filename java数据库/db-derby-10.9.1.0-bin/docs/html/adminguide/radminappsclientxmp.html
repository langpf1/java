<div class="section">
<p>The following examples specify the user and password URL attributes. 
To enable user authentication, you must either use NATIVE authentication or
explicitly set the property <em>derby.connection.requireAuthentication</em>
to true. Otherwise, <span>Derby</span>
does not require a user name and password. For details on how to enable
user authentication, see "Working with user authentication" in the
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span>.</p>

<p>For a multi-user product, you would typically specify authentication for the
system in the <em>derby.properties</em> file for your
server, since it is in a trusted environment. The following property setting
specifies NATIVE authentication:</p>

<pre>derby.authentication.provider=NATIVE:myCredentialsDB:LOCAL</pre>

<div class="p"><div class="important"><span class="importanttitle">Important: </span>It is strongly recommended that production systems
rely on NATIVE authentication, an external directory service such as LDAP, or a
user-defined class for authentication. It is also strongly recommended that
production systems protect network connections with SSL/TLS.</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example 1</h2><p>The following example connects to the
default server name localhost on the default port, 1527, and to the database
sample.</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/sample;user=judy;password=no12see</pre>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example 2</h2><div class="p">The following example specifies both <span>Derby</span> and Network Client
driver attributes:  <pre>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/sample;create=true;user=judy;
password=no12see</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example 3</h2><p>This example connects to the default server
name localhost on the default port, 1527, and includes the path in the database
name portion of the URL.</p>
<pre>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/c:/my-db-dir/my-db-name;user=judy;
password=no12see</pre>

<p>For a programming example that shows how to connect to the server using
NATIVE authentication, see "NATIVE authentication and SQL authorization example"
in the <span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span>.</p>
