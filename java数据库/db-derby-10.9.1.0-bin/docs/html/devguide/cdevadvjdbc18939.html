<h1 class="topictitle1">IDEs and multiple JVMs</h1>



<div><p>When you use an integrated development environment (IDE) to build
a Java application, you can launch the application from within the IDE at
any point in the development process. Typically, the IDE launches a JVM dedicated
to the application. When the application completes, the JVM exits. Any database
connections established by the application are closed.</p>

<p>During the development of a database application, most IDEs allow you to
test individual database connections and queries without running the entire
application. When you test an individual database connection or query (which
requires a database connection), the IDE might launch a JVM that runs in a
specialized testing environment. In this case, when a test completes, the
JVM remains active and available for further testing, and the database connection
established during the test remains open.</p>

<p>Because of the behaviors of the IDE described above, if you use the embedded <span>Derby</span> JDBC driver, you may
encounter errors connecting in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>You test an individual query or database connection and then try to run
an application that uses the same database as the tested feature.   <p>The
database connection established by testing the connection or query stays open,
and prevents the application from establishing a connection to the same database.</p>
</li>

<li>You run an application, and before it completes (for example, while it
waits for user input), you attempt to run a second application or to test
a connection or query that uses the same database as the first application.</li>

</ul>
