<h1 class="topictitle1">Using Derby with IDEs</h1>



<div><p>When you use an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop
an embedded <span>Derby</span> application,
you might need to run <span>Derby</span> within
a server framework.</p>

<p>This is because an IDE might try connecting to the database from two different
JVMs, whereas only a single JVM instance should connect to a <span>Derby</span> database
at one time (multiple connections from the same JVM are allowed). </p>

<p>An "embedded <span>Derby</span> application"
is one which runs in the same JVM as the application. Such an application
uses the embedded <span>Derby</span> driver
(<em>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</em>) and connection URL (<samp class="codeph"><em>jdbc:derby:databaseName</em></samp>).
If you use this driver name or connection URL from the IDE, when the IDE tries
to open a second connection to the same database with the embedded <span>Derby</span>,
the attempt fails. Two JVMs cannot connect to the same database in embedded
mode.</p>

When you use an integrated development environment (IDE) to build a Java application, you can launch the application from within the IDE at any point in the development process. Typically, the IDE launches a JVM dedicated to the application. When the application completes, the JVM exits. Any database connections established by the application are closed.</li>
