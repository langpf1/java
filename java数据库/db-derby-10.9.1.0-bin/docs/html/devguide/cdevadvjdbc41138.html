<h1 class="topictitle1">Offering connection choices to the user</h1>



<div><p>JDBC's <em>java.sql.Driver.getPropertyInfo</em> method allows a generic
GUI tool to determine the properties for which it should prompt a user in
order to get enough information to connect to a database. Depending on the
values the user has supplied so far, additional values might become necessary.
It might be necessary to iterate though several calls to <em>getPropertyInfo</em>.</p>

<p>If no more properties are necessary, the call returns an array of zero
length.</p>

<p>In a <span>Derby</span> system, do
not use the method against an instance of <em>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</em>.
Instead, request the JDBC driver from the driver manager:</p>

<pre>java.sql.DriverManager.getDriver(
    "jdbc:derby:").getPropertyInfo(<em>URL</em>, <em>Prop</em>)</pre>

<p>In a <span>Derby</span> system, the
properties returned in the <em>DriverPropertyInfo</em> object are connection
URL attributes, including a list of booted databases in a system (the <em>databaseName</em> attribute).</p>

<p>Databases in a system are not automatically booted until you connect with
them. You can configure your system to retain the former behavior, in which
case the steps described in this section will continue to work. See "<em>derby.system.bootAll</em>" in
the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>

<p><em>getPropertyInfo</em> requires a connection URL and a <em>Properties</em> object
as parameters. Typically, what you pass are values that you will use in a
future call to <em>java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection</em> when
you actually connect to the database.</p>

<p>A call to <em>getPropertyInfo</em> with parameters that contain sufficient
information to connect successfully returns an array of zero length. (Receiving
this zero-length array does not <em>guarantee</em> that the <em>getConnection</em> call
will succeed, because something else could go wrong.)</p>

<p>Repeat calls to <em>getPropertyInfo</em> until it returns a zero-length array
or none of the properties remaining are desired.</p>

When a non-zero-length array is returned by getPropertyInfo, each element is a DriverPropertyInfo object representing a connection URL attribute that has not already been specified. Only those that make sense in the current context are returned.</li>
