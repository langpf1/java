<h1 class="topictitle1">Statement versus transaction runtime rollback</h1>



<div><p>When an SQL statement generates an exception, this exception results
in a <em>runtime rollback</em>. A runtime rollback is a system-generated rollback
of a statement or transaction by <span>Derby</span>,
as opposed to an explicit <samp class="codeph"><em>rollback</em></samp> call from your
application.</p>

<p>Extremely severe exceptions, such as disk-full errors, shut down the system,
and the transaction is rolled back when the database is next booted. Severe
exceptions, such as deadlock, cause transaction rollback; <span>Derby</span> rolls
back all changes since the beginning of the transaction and implicitly begins
a new transaction. Less severe exceptions, such as syntax errors, result in
statement rollback; <span>Derby</span> rolls
back only changes made by the statement that caused the error. The application
developer can insert code to explicitly roll back the entire transaction if
desired.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> supports partial
rollback through the use of savepoints. See 
<a href="cdevconceptssavepoints.html#cdevconceptssavepoints">Using savepoints</a> for more
information.</p>
