<h1 class="topictitle1">Lock granularity</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> can be
configured for <em>table-level</em> locking. With table-level locking, when
a transaction locks data in order to prevent any transaction anomalies, it
always locks the entire table, not just those rows being accessed.</p>

<p>By default, <span>Derby</span> is
configured for row-level locking. Row-level locking uses more memory but allows
greater concurrency, which works better in multi-user systems. Table-level
locking works best with single-user applications or read-only applications. </p>

<p>You typically set lock granularity for the entire <span>Derby</span> system,
not for a particular application. However, at runtime, <span>Derby</span> may
escalate the lock granularity for a particular transaction from row-level
locking to table-level locking for performance reasons. You have some control
over the threshold at which this occurs. For information on turning off row-level
locking, see "<em>derby.storage.rowLocking</em>" in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.
For more information about automatic lock escalation, see "About the system's
selection of lock granularity" and "Transaction-based lock escalation" in <span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span>. For more
information on tuning your <span>Derby</span> system,
see "Tuning databases and applications," also in
<span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span>.</p>
