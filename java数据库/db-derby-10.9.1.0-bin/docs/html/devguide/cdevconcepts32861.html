<h1 class="topictitle1">Programming applications to handle deadlocks</h1>



<div><p>When you configure your system for deadlock and lockwait timeouts
and an application could be chosen as a victim when the transaction times
out, you should program your application to handle them.</p>

<p>To do this, test for <em>SQLExceptions</em> with <samp class="codeph"><em>SQLStates</em></samp> of
40001 (deadlock timeout) or 40XL1 or 40XL2 (lockwait timeout).</p>

<p>In the case of a deadlock you might want to re-try the transaction that
was chosen as a victim. In the case of a lock wait timeout, you probably do
not want to do this right away.</p>

<p>The following code is one example of how to handle a deadlock timeout.</p>

<pre><strong>/// if this code might encounter a deadlock, 
// put the whole thing in a try/catch block
// then try again if the deadlock victim exception 
// was thrown</strong>
try {
    s6.executeUpdate(
         "UPDATE employee " +
         "SET bonus = 625 "
         "WHERE empno='000150'");
    s6.executeUpdate("UPDATE project " +
         "SET respemp = '000150' " +
         "WHERE projno='IF1000'");
} 
<strong>// note: do not catch such exceptions in database-side methods; 
// catch such exceptions only at the outermost level of 
// application code. 
// See <a href="cdevspecial41728.html#cdevspecial41728">Database-side JDBC routines and SQLExceptions</a>. </strong> 
catch (SQLException se) { 
    if (se.getSQLState().equals("40001")) { 
        <strong>// it was chosen as a victim of a deadlock. 
        // try again at least once at this point.</strong> 
        System.out.println( "Will try the transaction again."); 
        s6.executeUpdate("UPDATE employee " + 
        "SET bonus = 625 " + 
        "WHERE empno='000150'"); 
        s6.executeUpdate("UPDATE project " + 
        "SET respemp = 000150 " + 
        "WHERE projno='IF1000'"); 
    } 
    else throw se; 
}
</pre>
