<h1 class="topictitle1">The JDBC connection and transaction model</h1>



<div><p>Session and transaction capabilities for SQL are handled through
JDBC routines, not by SQL commands.</p>

<p>JDBC defines a system session and transaction model for database access.
A <em>session</em> is the duration of one connection to the database and is
handled by a JDBC <em>Connection</em> object.</p>

</div>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts36881.html">Connections</a></strong><br />
A Connection object represents a connection with a database.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts19173.html">Transactions</a></strong><br />
A transaction is a set of one or more SQL statements that make up a logical unit of work that you can either commit or roll back and that will be recovered in the event of a system failure.</li>
