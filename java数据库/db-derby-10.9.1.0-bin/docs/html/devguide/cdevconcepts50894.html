<h1 class="topictitle1">Debugging Deadlocks</h1>



<div><p>If deadlocks occur frequently in your multi-user system with a
particular application, you might need to do some debugging.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> provides a class
    to help you in this situation, <em>org.apache.derby.diag.LockTable</em>.
    Access to the <em>LockTable</em> information is provided via the
    SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table.</p>

<p>The SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE
diagnostic table shows all of the locks that are currently held in the <span>Derby</span> database. 
You can reference the SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table directly
in a statement.</p>

<div class="p">For
    example:<pre>SELECT * FROM SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE</pre>
</div>

<p>When
the SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table is referenced in a statement, a
snapshot of the lock table is taken.
</p>
<div class="p">
    For more information about how to use this table:
    <ul>
        <li>See "SYSCS_DIAG diagnostic tables and functions" in the
            <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</li>

        <li>See the <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/javadoc/engine/org/apache/derby/diag/LockTable.html" target="_blank">LockTable API documentation</a>.
        </li>

    </ul>

    You
can also set the property <em>derby.locks.deadlockTrace</em> to dump additional
information to the derby.log file about any deadlocks that occur on your system. 
See the Tuning Guide for more information on this property. For information, see the <cite><span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite>.</div>

<p>Additional general information about diagnosing locking problems can be
    found in the <span>Derby</span>
    Wiki at <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/LockDebugging" target="_blank">
        http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/LockDebugging</a>.
