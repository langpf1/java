<h1 class="topictitle1">Avoiding deadlocks</h1>



<div><p>Using both row-level locking and the TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
isolation level makes it likely that you will avoid deadlocks (both settings
are <span>Derby</span> defaults). However,
deadlocks are still possible.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> application developers
can avoid deadlocks by using consistent application logic; for example, transactions
that access <em>Accounts</em> and <em>Orders</em> should always access the tables
in the same order. That way, in the scenario described above, Transaction
B simply waits for transaction A to release the lock on <em>Orders</em> before
it begins. When transaction A releases the lock on <em>Orders</em>, Transaction
B can proceed freely.</p>

<p>Another tool available to you is the LOCK TABLE statement. A transaction
can attempt to lock a table in exclusive mode when it starts to prevent other
transactions from getting shared locks on a table. For more information, see
"LOCK TABLE statement" in the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>
