<h1 class="topictitle1">Transactions when auto-commit is disabled</h1>



<div><p>When auto-commit is disabled, you use a <em>Connection</em> object's <samp class="codeph"><em>commit</em></samp> and <samp class="codeph"><em>rollback</em></samp> methods
to commit or roll back a transaction.</p>

<p>The <samp class="codeph"><em>commit</em></samp> method makes permanent the changes resulting
from the transaction and releases locks. The <samp class="codeph"><em>rollback</em></samp> method
undoes all the changes resulting from the transaction and releases locks.
A transaction encompasses all the SQL statements executed against a single <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp> object
since the last <samp class="codeph"><em>commit</em></samp> or <samp class="codeph"><em>rollback</em></samp>.</p>

<p>You do not need to explicitly begin a transaction. You implicitly end one
transaction and begin a new one after disabling auto-commit, changing the
isolation level, or after calling <samp class="codeph"><em>commit</em></samp> or <samp class="codeph"><em>rollback</em></samp>.</p>

<p>Committing a transaction also closes all <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> objects
excluding the <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> objects associated with cursors
with holdability <samp class="codeph">true</samp>. The default holdability of the cursors
is <samp class="codeph">true</samp> and <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> objects associated
with them need to be closed explicitly. A commit will not close such <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> objects.
It also releases any database locks currently held by the <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp>,
whether or not these objects were created in different threads.</p>
