<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring security for your environment</h1>



<div><p>In most cases, you enable <span>Derby</span>'s
security features through the use of properties. It is important to understand
the best way of setting properties for your environment.</p>

<div class="section"><p><span>Derby</span> does
not come with a built-in superuser. For that reason, be careful when configuring <span>Derby</span> for user authentication
and user authorization. </p>
<ol>
<li>When first working with security, work with system-level properties only
so that you can easily override them if you make a mistake. </li>

<li>Be sure to create at least one valid user, and grant that user full (read-write)
access. For example, you might always want to create a user called <em>sa</em> with
the password <em><span>derby</span></em> while
you are developing. </li>

<li>Test the authentication system while it is still configured at the system
level. Be absolutely certain that you have configured the system correctly
before setting the properties as database-level properties.</li>

<li>Before disabling system-level properties (by setting <em>derby.database.propertiesOnly</em> to
true), test that at least one database-level read-write user (such as <em>sa</em>)
is valid. If you do not have at least one valid user that the system can authenticate,
you will not be able to access your database.</li>

</ol>
