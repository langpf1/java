<h1 class="topictitle1">Users and authorization identifiers</h1>



<div><p>User names within the <span>Derby</span> system
are known as <em>authorization identifiers</em>. The authorization identifier
is a string that represents the name of the user, if one was provided in the
connection request.</p>

<p>For example, the built-in function CURRENT_USER returns the authorization
identifier for the current user.</p>

<p>Once the authorization identifier is passed to the <span>Derby</span> system,
it becomes an <em>SQL92Identifier</em>. <samp class="codeph"><em>SQL92Identifiers</em></samp>-the
kind of identifiers that represent database objects such as tables and columns-are
case-insensitive (they are converted to all caps) unless delimited with double
quotes, are limited to 128 characters, and have other limitations.</p>

<p>User names must be valid authorization identifiers even if user authentication
is turned off, and even if all users are allowed access to all databases.</p>

<p>For more information about <em>SQL92Identifiers</em>, see the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure24458.html">Authorization identifiers, user authentication, and user authorization</a></strong><br />
When working with both user authentication and user authorization, you need to understand how user names are treated by each system.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecureDbOwner.html">Database owner</a></strong><br />
The term database owner refers to the current authorization identifier when the database is created, that is, the user creating the database. If you use NATIVE authentication, or if you manually enable or plan to enable SQL authorization, controlling the identity of the database owner becomes important.</li>

Specifying an invalid authorization identifier in a database user authorization property raises an exception. Specifying an invalid authorization identifier in a connection request raises an exception.</li>
