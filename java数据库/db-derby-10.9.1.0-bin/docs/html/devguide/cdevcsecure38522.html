<h1 class="topictitle1">External directory service</h1>



<div><p>A directory service stores names and attributes of those names.
A typical use for a directory service is to store user names and passwords
for a computer system. <span>Derby</span> uses
the Java naming and directory interface (JNDI) to interact with external directory
services that can provide authentication of users' names and passwords.</p>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure41285.html">LDAP directory service</a></strong><br />
You can allow Derby to authenticate users against an existing LDAP directory service within your enterprise. LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol) provides an open directory access protocol running over TCP/IP. An LDAP directory service can quickly authenticate a user's name and password.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure864242.html">JNDI-specific properties for external directory services</a></strong><br />
Derby allows you to set a few advanced JNDI properties, which you can set in any of the supported ways of setting Derby properties. Typically you would set these at the same level (database or system) for which you configured the external authentication service.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure21561.html">User-defined class</a></strong><br />
Set derby.authentication.provider to the full name of a class that implements the public interface org.apache.derby.authentication.UserAuthenticator.</li>
