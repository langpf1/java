<h1 class="topictitle1">Signed jar files</h1>



<div><p>In a Java SE environment, <span>Derby</span> can
detect digital signatures on jar files. When attempting to load a class from
a signed jar file stored in the database, <span>Derby</span> will
verify the validity of the signature.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>The <span>Derby</span> class loader
only validates the integrity of the signed jar file and that the certificate
has not expired. <span>Derby</span> cannot
ascertain whether the validity/identity of declared signer is correct. To
validate identity, use a Security Manager (i.e., an implementation of <em>java.lang.SecurityManager</em>).</div>

<p>When loading classes from an application jar file in a Java SE environment, <span>Derby</span> behaves as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>If the class is signed, <span>Derby</span> will:</em> 
 <ul>
<li>Verify that the jar was signed using a X.509 certificate (i.e., can be
represented by the class <em>java.security.cert.X509Certificate</em>). If not,
throw an exception. </li>

<li>Verify that the digital signature matches the contents of the file. If
not, throw an exception. </li>

<li>Check that the set of signing certificates are all valid for the current
date and time. If any certificate has expired or is not yet valid, throw an
exception.</li>

<li>Pass the array of certificates to the <em>setSigners()</em> method of
<em>java.lang.ClassLoader</em>. This allows security managers to obtain the list
of signers for a class (using <em>java.lang.Class.getSigners</em>)
and then validate the identity of the signers using the services of a Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI). </li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span><span>Derby</span> does not provide
a security manager.</div>
