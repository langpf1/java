<div><p>
  The term <em>database owner</em> refers to the current authorization
  identifier when the database is created, that is, the user creating
  the database. If you use NATIVE authentication, or if you manually enable
  or plan to enable SQL authorization,
  controlling the identity of the database owner becomes important.
</p>

  <p>
    When a database is created, the database owner of that database
    gets implicitly set to the authorization identifier used in the
    connect operation which creates the database, for example by
    supplying the URL attribute "user".  Note that this applies even
    if authentication is not (yet) enabled.  In SQL, the built-in
    functions USER and the equivalent CURRENT_USER return the current
    authorization identifier.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the database is created <em>without</em> supplying a user (only
    possible if authentication is not enabled), the database owner
    gets set to the default authorization identifier, "APP", which is
    also the name of the default schema, see the section "SET
    SCHEMA statement" in
    the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The database owner has automatic SQL level permissions when
    SQL authorization is enabled, see more about this
    in <a href="cdevcsecure36595.html#cdevcsecure36595">User authorizations</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To further enhance security, when <em>both</em>
    <a href="cdevcsecure36127.html#cdevcsecure36127">authentication</a>
    and SQL authorization are enabled for a
    database, Derby restricts some special powers to the database
    owner: only the database owner is allowed to
    <a href="tdevdvlp40464.html#tdevdvlp40464">shut down</a>
    the database, to
    <a href="tdevcsecureunencrypteddb.html#tdevcsecureunencrypteddb">encrypt</a>
    or
    <a href="tdevcsecurenewkeyoverview.html#tdevcsecurenewkeyoverview">reencrypt</a>
    the database or to perform a
    <a href="tdevupgradedb.html#tdevupgradedb">full upgrade</a>
    of it. These powers can not be delegated.
  </p>

  <div class="p">
    <div class="attention"><span class="attentiontitle">Attention: </span>
      There is currently no way of changing the database owner once
      the database is created. This means that if you plan to run with
      SQL authorization enabled, you should make sure to create the
      database as the user you want to be the owner.
