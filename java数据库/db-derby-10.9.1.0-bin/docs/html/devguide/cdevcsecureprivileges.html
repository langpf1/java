<h1 class="topictitle1">Privileges on views, triggers, and constraints</h1>



<div><p>Views, triggers, and constraints operate with the privileges of the
owner of the view, trigger, or constraint.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that user <samp class="codeph">anita</samp> wants to create a view
using the following statement:</p>

<pre>CREATE VIEW s.v(vc1,vc2,vc3)
	AS SELECT t1.c1,t1.c2,f(t1.c3)
  FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 
	WHERE t2.c2 = 5</pre>

<p>User <samp class="codeph">anita</samp> needs the following privileges to create the
view:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ownership of the schema <samp class="codeph">s</samp>, so that she can create something
in the schema</li>

<li>Ownership of the table <samp class="codeph">t1</samp>, so that she can allow others
to see columns in the table</li>

<li>SELECT privilege on column <samp class="codeph">t2.c1</samp> and column
<samp class="codeph">t2.c2</samp></li>

<li>EXECUTE privilege on function <samp class="codeph">f</samp></li>

</ul>

<p>When the view is created, only user <samp class="codeph">anita</samp> has the SELECT
privilege on it. User <samp class="codeph">anita</samp> can grant the SELECT privilege on
any or all of the columns of view <samp class="codeph">s.v</samp> to anyone, even to users
that do not have the SELECT privilege on <samp class="codeph">t1</samp> or
<samp class="codeph">t2</samp>, or the EXECUTE privilege on <samp class="codeph">f</samp>. User
<samp class="codeph">anita</samp> then grants the SELECT privilege on view
<samp class="codeph">s.v</samp> to user <samp class="codeph">harry</samp>. When user
<samp class="codeph">harry</samp> issues a SELECT statement on the view
<samp class="codeph">s.v</samp>, <span>Derby</span>
checks to determine if user <samp class="codeph">harry</samp> has the SELECT privilege on
view <samp class="codeph">s.v</samp>.
<span>Derby</span> does not check to
determine if user <samp class="codeph">harry</samp> has the SELECT privilege on
<samp class="codeph">t1</samp> or <samp class="codeph">t2</samp>, or the EXECUTE privilege on
<samp class="codeph">f</samp>.</p>

<p>Privileges on triggers and constraints work the same way as privileges on
views. When a view, trigger, or constraint is created,
<span>Derby</span> checks that the owner
has the required privileges. Other users do not need to have those privileges
to perform actions on a view, trigger, or constraint.</p>

<p>If the required privileges are revoked from the owner of a view, trigger,
or constraint, the object is dropped as part of the REVOKE statement.</p>

<p>Another way of saying that privileges on objects belong to the owner is to
call them <dfn class="term">definer rights</dfn>, as opposed to <dfn class="term">invoker rights</dfn>.
This is the terminology used by the SQL standard.</p>
