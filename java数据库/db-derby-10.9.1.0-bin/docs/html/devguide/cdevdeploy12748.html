<h1 class="topictitle1">Code your applications</h1>



<div><p>In your applications, you load the classes either by indirectly
referencing them in the code or by directly using <em>java.lang.Class.forName</em>.</p>

<p>You load resources the way you normally would, using the standard <em>java.lang.Class.getResourceAsStream</em>,
a mechanism that allows an application to access resources defined in the
classpath without knowing where or how they are stored.</p>

<p>You do not need to make any changes to the way code interacts with <span>Derby</span> and its JDBC driver.
An application can safely attempt to boot <span>Derby</span>,
even though it is already running, without any errors. Applications connect
to <span>Derby</span> in the usual manner.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>The method <em>getResource</em> is not supported.</div>
