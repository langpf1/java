<h1 class="topictitle1">Create jar files for your application</h1>



<div><p>Include any Java classes in a jar file that are intended for <span>Derby</span> class loading, except
the following classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The standard Java packages (<em>java.*</em>, <em>javax.*</em>)
  <p><span>Derby</span> does not prevent
you from storing such a jar file in the database, but these classes <em>are
never loaded</em> from the jar file.</p>
</li>

<li>The classes that are supplied with your Java environment (for example, <em>sun.*</em>)</li>

</ul>

<p>A running <span>Derby</span> system
can load classes from any number of jar files from any number of schemas and
databases.</p>

<p>Create jar files intended for <span>Derby</span> database
class loading the same way you create a jar file for inclusion in a user's
classpath. For example, consider an application targeted at travel agencies: </p>

<pre><strong>jar cf travelagent.jar travelagent/*.class.</strong></pre>

<p>Various IDEs have tools to generate a list of contents for a jar file based
on your application. If your application requires classes from other jar files,
you have a choice:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Extract the required third-party classes from their jar file and include
only those classes in your jar file.</em>   <p>Use this option when you need
only a small subset of the classes in the third-party jar file.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Store the third-party jar file in the database.</em>   <p>Use this option
when you need most or all of the classes in the third-party jar file, since
your application and third-party logic can be upgraded separately.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Deploy the third-party jar file in the user's class path.</em>   <p>Use
this option when the classes are already installed on a user's machine (for
example, Objectspace's JGL classes).</p>
</li>

</ul>
