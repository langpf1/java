<h1 class="topictitle1">Dynamic changes to jar files or to the database jar classpath</h1>



<div><p>When you store jar files in a single database and make those jar
files available to that database, it is possible to make changes to jar files
or to change the database jar "classpath" dynamically (without having to reboot).</p>

<p>That is, when you install or replace a jar file within an SQL statement
or change the database jar "classpath" (the <em>derby.database.classpath</em> property<samp class="codeph"><em>),</em></samp> <span>Derby</span> is able to load the new
classes right away without your having to reboot.</p>
