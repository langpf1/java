<h1 class="topictitle1">Enable database class loading with a property</h1>



<div><p>Once you have added one or more jar files to a database, you must
set the database jar classpath by including the jar file or files in the <em>derby.database.classpath</em> property
to enable <span>Derby</span> to load
classes from the jar files.</p>

<p>This property, which behaves like a classpath, specifies the jar files
to be searched for classes and resources and the order in which they are searched.
If <span>Derby</span> does not find
a needed class stored in the database, it can retrieve the class from the
user's classpath. (<span>Derby</span> first
looks in the user's classpath before looking in the database.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Separate jar files with a colon (<samp class="codeph">:</samp>).</li>

<li>Use fully qualified identifiers for the jar files (schema name and jar
name).</li>

<li>Set the property as a database-level property for the database.</li>

</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><strong>CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_DATABASE_PROPERTY(
    'derby.database.classpath',
    'APP.ToursLogic:APP.ACCOUNTINGLOGIC')</strong></pre>

<p>See "<em>derby.database.classpath</em>" in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for more information about the
property.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span><span>Derby</span>'s class loader
looks first in the user's classpath for any needed classes, and then in the
database. To ensure class loading with the database class loader, remove classes
from the classpath.</div>
