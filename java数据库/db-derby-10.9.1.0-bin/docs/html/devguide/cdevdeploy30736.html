<h1 class="topictitle1">Loading classes from a database</h1>



<div><p>You can store application logic in a database and then load classes
from the database.</p>

<p>Application logic, which can be used by SQL functions and procedures, includes
Java class files and other resources. Storing application code simplifies
application deployment, since it reduces the potential for problems with a
user's classpath.</p>

<p>In an embedded environment, when application logic is stored in the database, <span>Derby</span> can access classes loaded
by the <span>Derby</span> class loader
from stored jar files. </p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdeploy856753.html">Class loading overview</a></strong><br />
You store application classes and resources by storing one or more jar files in the database. Then your application can access classes loaded by Derby from the jar file and does not need to be coded in a particular way. The only difference is the way in which you invoke the application.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdeploy17604.html">Dynamic changes to jar files or to the database jar classpath</a></strong><br />
When you store jar files in a single database and make those jar files available to that database, it is possible to make changes to jar files or to change the database jar "classpath" dynamically (without having to reboot).</li>
</ul>
