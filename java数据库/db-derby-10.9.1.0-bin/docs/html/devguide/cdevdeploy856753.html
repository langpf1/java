<h1 class="topictitle1">Class loading overview</h1>



<div><p>You store application classes and resources by storing one or more
jar files in the database. Then your application can access classes loaded
by <span>Derby</span> from the jar file
and does not need to be coded in a particular way. The only difference is
the way in which you invoke the application.</p>

<p>Here are the basic steps.</p>

</div>

<div>
<ol>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="cdevdeploy15818.html">Create jar files for your application</a><br />
Include any Java classes in a jar file that are intended for Derby class loading, except the following classes:</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="cdevdeploy23812.html">Add the jar file or files to the database</a><br />
Use a set of procedures to install, replace, and remove jar files in a database. When you install a jar file in a database, you give it a Derby jar name, which is an SQL92Identifier.</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="cdevdeploy21645.html">Enable database class loading with a property</a><br />
Once you have added one or more jar files to a database, you must set the database jar classpath by including the jar file or files in the derby.database.classpath property to enable Derby to load classes from the jar files.</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="cdevdeploy12748.html">Code your applications</a><br />
In your applications, you load the classes either by indirectly referencing them in the code or by directly using java.lang.Class.forName.</li>
</ol>
