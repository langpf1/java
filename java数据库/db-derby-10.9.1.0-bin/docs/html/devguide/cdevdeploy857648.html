<h1 class="topictitle1">Notes on dynamic changes</h1>


<div>
<p>When you are changing the <em>derby.database.classpath</em> property, all
classes loaded from database jar files are reloaded, even for a jar file that
has not changed.</p>

<p>Remember that the user's classpath is searched first.</p>

<p>Any existing prepared statements will use the previously loaded classes
unless they require class loading, in which case they will fail with a <em>ClassNotFound</em> error.</p>

<p>Cached objects do not match objects created with newly loaded classes.
For example, an in-memory <em>Customer</em> object will not match a new <em>Customer</em> object
if the <em>Customer</em> class has been reloaded, and it will
raise a <em>ClassCastException</em>.</p>
