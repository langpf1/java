<h1 class="topictitle1">Derby JDBC database connection URL</h1>



<div><p>A Java application using the JDBC API establishes a connection
to a database by obtaining a <em>Connection</em> object.</p>

<p>The standard way to obtain a <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp> object
is to call the method <samp class="codeph"><em>DriverManager.getConnection</em></samp>,
which takes a String containing a connection URL (uniform resource locator).
A JDBC connection URL provides a way of identifying a database. It also allows
you to perform a number of high-level tasks, such as creating a database or
shutting down the system.</p>

<p>An application in an embedded environment uses a different connection URL
from that used by applications using the <span>Derby</span> Network
Server in a client/server environment. See the <cite><span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite> for
more information on the Network Server. </p>

<p>However, all versions of the connection URL (which you can use for tasks
besides connecting to a database) have common features:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can specify the name of the database you want to connect to</li>

<li>you can specify a number of attributes and values that allow you to accomplish
tasks. For more information about what you can specify with the <span>Derby</span> connection
URL, see <a href="rdevdvlp22102.html#rdevdvlp22102">Database connection examples</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>The connection URL syntax is as follows:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:[subsubprotocol:][<em>databaseName</em>][;<em>attribute</em>=<em>value</em>]*</pre>

<p><em>Subsubprotocol</em>, which is not typically specified, determines
how <span>Derby</span> looks for a database:
in a directory, in memory, in a class path, or in a jar file. <em>Subsubprotocol</em> is one of
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>directory</em>: The default, which need not be specified explicitly. The
database is in the file system, and the path is either relative to the system
directory or absolute.</li>

<li><em>memory</em>: Databases exist only in main memory and are not written to
disk. An in-memory database may be useful when there is no need to persist the
database -- for example, in some testing situations.</li>

<li><em>classpath</em>: Databases are treated as read-only databases, relative to
the <em>classpath</em> directory. See
<a href="cdevdvlp91854.html#cdevdvlp91854">Accessing databases from the classpath</a> for details.</li>

<li><em>jar</em>: Databases are treated as read-only databases. <em>DatabaseNames</em> might
require a leading slash, because you specify them "relative" to the jar file.
See <a href="cdevdvlp24155.html#cdevdvlp24155">Accessing databases from a jar or zip file</a> for details.
<p><em>jar</em> requires an additional element immediately before the
database name:</p>

<pre>(<em>pathToArchive</em>)</pre>

<p><em>pathToArchive</em> is the path to the jar or zip file that holds
the database.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>For detailed reference about connection URL attributes and values, see 
"Setting attributes for the database connection URL" in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.
</p>

<p>The following example shows the use of the connection URL:</p>

<pre>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:sample");</pre>
