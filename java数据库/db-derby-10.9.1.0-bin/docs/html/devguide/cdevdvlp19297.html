<h1 class="topictitle1">Recommended practices</h1>



<div><p>When developing <span>Derby</span> applications,
create a single directory to hold your database or databases.</p>

<div class="p">Give this directory a unique name, to help you remember that: <ul>
<li>All databases exist within a system.</li>

<li>System-wide properties affect the entire system, and persistent system-wide
properties live in the system directory.</li>

<li>You can boot all the databases in the system, and the boot-up times of
all databases affect the performance of the system.</li>

<li>You can preboot databases only if they are within the system. (Databases
do not necessarily have to live inside the system <em>directory</em>, but keeping
your databases there is the recommended practice.)</li>

<li>Once you connect to a database, it is part of the current system and thus
inherits all system-wide properties.</li>

<li>Only one instance of <span>Derby</span> can
run in a JVM at a single time.</li>

<li>The error log is located inside the system directory.</li>

</ul>
