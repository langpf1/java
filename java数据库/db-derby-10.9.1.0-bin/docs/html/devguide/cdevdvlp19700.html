<div><p>You can also access databases from the classpath or from a jar
file (in the classpath or not) as read-only databases.</p>

<p>You can create in-memory databases for use in testing and development and for
processing temporary or reproducible data. See
<a href="cdevdvlpinmemdb.html#cdevdvlpinmemdb">Using in-memory databases</a> for details.</p>

In most cases, you access databases from the file system. However, it is also possible to access databases from the classpath. The databases can be archived into a jar or zip file or left as is.</li>
