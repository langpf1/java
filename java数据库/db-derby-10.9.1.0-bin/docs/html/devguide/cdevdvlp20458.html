<h1 class="topictitle1">Double-booting system behavior</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> prevents
two instances of itself from booting the same database by using a file called
<em>db.lck</em> inside the database directory.</p>

<p>If a second instance of
<span>Derby</span> attempts to boot an
already running database, the following error messages appear:</p>

<pre>
ERROR XJ040: Failed to start database 'firstdb', see the next exception
for details.
ERROR XSDB6: Another instance of Derby may have already booted the
database /home/myself/DERBYTUTOR/firstdb.
</pre>

<p>In addition, a stack trace appears in the <em>derby.log</em> file. For help
diagnosing a double boot problem, use the
<em>derby.stream.error.logBootTrace</em> property to obtain information about
both successful and unsuccessful boot attempts. The property is described in
the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>

<p>If you need to access a single database from more than one
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you will need to put a server solution in place. You
can allow applications from multiple JVMs that need to access that database to
connect to the server. The
<span>Derby</span> Network Server is
provided as a server solution. For basic information on starting and using the
Network Server, see <span><em>Getting Started with Derby</em></span>. See the
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span> for more information on the
Network Server.</p>
