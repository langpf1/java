<h1 class="topictitle1">Accessing databases from a jar or zip file</h1>



<div><p>It is possible to access databases from a jar file. The jar file
does not have to be on the classpath.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>All such databases are read-only.</div>

<p>For example, suppose you have archived the database <em>jarDB1</em> into
a file called <em>jar1.jar</em>. This archive is in the classpath before you
start up <span>Derby</span>. You can
access <em>jarDB1</em> with the following connection URL</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:classpath:jarDB1</pre>

<p>To access a database in a jar file that is not on the classpath, use the
<em>jar</em> subprotocol. </p>

<p>For example, suppose you have archived the database <em>jarDB2</em> into
a file called <em>jar2.jar</em>. This archive is not in the classpath. You can
access <em>jarDB2</em> by specifying the path to the jar file along with the
<em>jar</em> subsubprotocol, like this:</p>

<pre>
jdbc:derby:jar:(c:/<span>derby</span>/lib/jar2.jar)jarDB2
</pre>

<p>For complete instructions and examples of accessing databases in jar files,
see <a href="cdevdeploy11201.html#cdevdeploy11201">Accessing a read-only database in a zip/jar file</a>.</p>
