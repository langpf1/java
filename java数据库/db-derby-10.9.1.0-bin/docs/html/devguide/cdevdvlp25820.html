<h1 class="topictitle1">Database pages</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> tables
and indexes, known as conglomerates, consist of two or more pages.</p>

<p>A page is a unit of storage whose size is configurable on a system-wide,
database-wide, or conglomerate-specific basis. By default, a conglomerate
grows one page at a time until eight pages of user data (or nine pages of
total disk use, which includes one page of internal information) have been
allocated. (You can configure this behavior; see
"<em>derby.storage.initialPages</em>" in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.) After that, it grows
eight pages at a time.</p>

<p>The size of a row or column is not limited by the page size. Rows or columns
that are longer than the table's page size are automatically wrapped to overflow
pages. </p>
