<h1 class="topictitle1">Conventions for specifying the database path</h1>



<div><p>When you access databases from the file system (instead of from
the classpath or a jar file), any path that is not absolute is interpreted as
relative to the system directory.</p>

<p>The path must do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>refer to a previously created <span>Derby</span> database</li>

<li>specify the <em>create=true</em> attribute</li>

</ul>

<p>The path separator in the connection URL is / (forward slash), as in the
standard <em>file:// </em>URL protocol.</p>

<p>You can specify only databases that are local to the machine on which the
JVM is running. NFS file systems on UNIX and remote shared files on Windows
(//<em>machine/directory</em>) are not guaranteed to work. Using <em>derby.system.home</em> and
forward slashes is recommended practice for platform independent applications.</p>

<p>If two different database name values, relative or absolute, refer to the
same actual directory, they are considered equivalent. This means that connections
to a database through its absolute path and its relative path are connections
to the same database. Within <span>Derby</span>,
the name of the database is defined by the canonical path of its directory
from <cite>java.io.File.getCanonicalPath</cite>.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> automatically
creates any intermediate directory that does not already exist when creating
a new database. If it cannot create the intermediate directory, the database
creation fails.</p>
