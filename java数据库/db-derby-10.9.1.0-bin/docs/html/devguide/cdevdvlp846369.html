<h1 class="topictitle1">Connecting to databases within the system</h1>



<div><p>The standard way to access databases in the file system is by specifying
the path to the database, either absolute or relative to the system directory.
In a client/server environment, this path is always on the <em>server</em> machine.</p>

<p>By default, you can connect to databases within the current system directory
(see <a href="cdevdvlp13018.html#cdevdvlp13018">Defining the system directory</a>). To connect to
databases within the current system, just specify the database name on the
connection URL. For example, if your system directory contains a database
called <em>myDB</em>, you can connect to that database with the following connection
URL:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:myDB</pre>

<p>The full call within a Java program would be:</p>

<pre>Connection conn =DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:myDB");</pre>
