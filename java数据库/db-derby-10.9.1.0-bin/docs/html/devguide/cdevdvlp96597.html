<h1 class="topictitle1">One Derby instance for each Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h1>



<div><p>You could potentially have two instances of a <span>Derby</span> system
running on the same machine at the same time. Each instance must run
in a different Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

<p>If you use the embedded driver, two
separate instances of <span>Derby</span>
cannot access the same database. If
a <span>Derby</span> instance attempts 
to access a running database, an error message appears, and a stack trace
appears in the <em>derby.log</em> file. If you want more than one
<span>Derby</span> instance to be able
to access the same database, you can use the Network Server.</p>

<p>If a <span>Derby</span> instance
uses the in-memory database capability for its database connection, the database
exists only within the JVM of that
<span>Derby</span> instance. Another
<span>Derby</span> instance could refer to
the same database name, but it would not be referring to the same actual
database, and no error would result.</p>
