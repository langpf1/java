<h1 class="topictitle1">Using in-memory databases</h1>



<div><p>For testing and developing applications, or for processing transient
or reproducible data, you can use
<span>Derby</span>'s in-memory database
facility.</p>

<p>An in-memory database resides completely in main memory, not in the file
system. It is useful for testing and developing applications, when you may want
to create and discard databases that will never be used again. It is also 
useful when you need to process only temporary or reproducible data.</p>

<p>If you have the required memory available, you may also benefit from faster
processing (no disk I/O) and from the simplicity of not having to explicitly
delete databases you have finished with.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Creating an in-memory database</h2>
<p>To create an in-memory database, specify <samp class="codeph">memory</samp> as the JDBC
subsubprotocol. For example, to create an in-memory database named
<samp class="codeph">myDB</samp> using the embedded driver, use the following connection
URL:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:memory:myDB;create=true</pre>

<p>For the network client driver, use the following connection URL. Because
the client driver does not understand the <samp class="codeph">memory</samp>
subsubprotocol, you must include it in the database name:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby://<em>myhost</em>:1527/memory:myDB;create=true</pre>

<p>Be careful to specify a colon (<samp class="codeph">:</samp>) after
<samp class="codeph">memory</samp>.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Referring to in-memory databases</h2>
<p>When you create or refer to an in-memory database, any path that is not
absolute is interpreted as relative to the system directory, just as with file
system databases. For example, if the system directory is
<samp class="codeph">C:\myderby</samp>, the following paths are regarded as
equivalent:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:memory:db
jdbc:derby:memory:C:\myderby\db</pre>

<p>Similarly, <span>Derby</span> treats
the following URLs as names for the same in-memory database:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:memory:/home/myname/db
jdbc:derby:memory:/home/myname/../myname/db</pre>

<p><a href="cdevdvlp40350.html#cdevdvlp40350">Conventions for specifying the database path</a> has more information on
database paths.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Using in-memory databases</h2>
<p>When you use an in-memory database, you need to make sure to configure the
heap and the <span>Derby</span> page
cache size. See "Configure
<span>Derby</span> to use an in-memory
database" in <span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span> for details.</p>

<p>For examples of how to use an in-memory database, see some of the
<samp class="codeph">ij</samp> command examples in the
<span><em>Derby Tools and Utilities Guide</em></span> (<samp class="codeph">execute</samp>
and <samp class="codeph">async</samp>, for example).</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Removing an in-memory database</h2>
<p>To remove an in-memory database, use the connection URL attribute <em>drop</em>
as follows:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:memory:myDB;drop=true</pre>

<pre>jdbc:derby://<em>myhost</em>:1527/memory:myDB;drop=true</pre>

<p>You can shut down an in-memory database using the <em>shutdown=true</em>
attribute before you drop the database, but this is optional. Dropping the
database also performs the shutdown.</p>

<p>When you drop the database,
<span>Derby</span> issues what appears to
be an error but is actually an indication of success. You need to catch error
08006, as described in "The WwdEmbedded program" in
<span><em>Getting Started with Derby</em></span>.</p>

<p>
If user
<a href="cdevcsecure36127.html#cdevcsecure36127">authentication</a>
and
<a href="cdevcsecure36595.html#cdevcsecure36595">SQL authorization</a>
are both enabled, only the
<a href="cdevcsecureDbOwner.html#cdevcsecureDbOwner">database owner</a>
can drop the database.
</p>

<p>An in-memory database is automatically removed if any of the following
happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is shut down normally (for example, if you
exit the <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> tool)</li>

<li>The JVM crashes</li>

<li>The machine you are running on crashes or shuts down</li>

</ul>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Persisting an in-memory database</h2>
<p>If you create an in-memory database and then decided that you want to keep it
after all, you can use one of the backup system procedures
(SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE, for example) to persist it. You can then boot
it as an in-memory database at a later time, or use it as a normal file system
database. See "Backing up and restoring databases" in
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span> for information on using the
backup procedures.</p>
