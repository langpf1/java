<div><p><span>Derby</span> offers
support for locales.</p>

<p>The word <em>locale</em> in the Java platform refers to an instance of a
class that identifies a particular combination of language and region. If
a Java class varies its behavior according to <em>locale</em>, it is said to
be locale-sensitive. <span>Derby</span> provides
some support for locales for databases and other components such as the tools
and the installer.</p>

<p>It also provides a feature to support databases in many different languages,
a feature which is independent of a particular territory.</p>

<p>When you create or upgrade a database, you can use the territory attribute
to associate a non-default territory with the database. For information about
how to use the territory attribute, see the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>
