<h1 class="topictitle1">Other components with locale support</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> also provides
locale support for the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database error messages are in the language of the locale, if support
is explicitly provided for that locale with a special library.   <p>For example, <span>Derby</span> explicitly supports Spanish-language
error messages. If a database's locale is set to one of the Spanish-language
locales, <span>Derby</span> returns
error messages in the Spanish language.</p>
 </li>

<li>The <span>Derby</span> tools. In
the case of the tools, locale support includes locale-specific interface and
error messages and localized data display.   <p>For more information about
localization of the <span>Derby</span> tools,
see the <cite><span><em>Derby Tools and Utilities Guide</em></span></cite>. </p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Localized messages require special libraries.</p>

<p>The locale of the database is set by the <em>territory=ll_CC</em> attribute
when the database is created. However, the locale of the error messages and
tools is not determined by the locale of the database. The locale of the error
messages and tools is determined by the default system locale. This means
that it is possible to create a database with a non-default locale. In such
a case, error messages are not returned in the language of the locale of the
database but are returned in the language of the default locale instead.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>You can override the default locale for ij with a property on the JVM.
For more information, see the <cite><span><em>Derby Tools and Utilities Guide</em></span></cite>.</div>
