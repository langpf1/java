<h1 class="topictitle1">Scope of properties</h1>


<div>
<div class="p">You use properties to configure a
<span>Derby</span> system, database, or
conglomerate.
<ul>
<li><em>system-wide</em>  
<p>Most properties can be set on a <em>system-wide</em> basis; that is, you set a
property for the entire system and all its databases and conglomerates, if this
is applicable. Some properties, such as error handling and automatic booting,
can be configured only in this way, since they apply to the entire system. (For
information about the <span>Derby</span>
system, see <a href="cdevdvlp27610.html#cdevdvlp27610">Derby system</a>.)</p>
</li>

<li><em>database-wide</em>  
<p>Some properties can also be set on a <em>database-wide</em> basis. That is, the
property is true for the selected database only and not for the other databases
in the system unless it is set individually within each of them.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>For properties that affect conglomerates, changing the value of such
properties affects only conglomerates that are created after the change.
Conglomerates created earlier are unaffected.</p>

<div class="p"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Database-wide properties are stored in the database and are simpler for
deployment, in the sense that they follow the database. Database-wide properties
are also recommended for security reasons when you use
<span>Derby</span> BUILTIN user
authentication (see <a href="cdevcsecuree.html#cdevcsecuree">Derby and security</a>).
System-wide properties can be more practical during the development
process.</div>
</div>

<div class="p"><div class="important"><span class="importanttitle">Important: </span><span>Derby</span>'s
BUILTIN authentication mechanism is suitable only for development and testing
purposes, and it will no longer be documented in future releases. It is strongly
recommended that production systems rely on NATIVE authentication, an external
directory service such as LDAP, or a user-defined class for authentication. It
is also strongly recommended that production systems protect network connections
with SSL/TLS.</div>
