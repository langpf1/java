<h1 class="topictitle1">Database-side JDBC routines and nested connections</h1>



<div><p>Most database-side JDBC routines need to share the same transaction
space as the statements that called them.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>to avoid blocking and deadlocks</li>

<li>to ensure that any updates done from within the routine are atomic with
the outer transaction</li>

</ul>

<p>In order to use the same transaction, the routine must use the same connection
as the parent SQL statement in which the routine was executed. Connections
re-used in this way are called <em>nested connections</em>.</p>

<p>Use the connection URL <em>jdbc:default:connection</em> to re-use the current <em>Connection</em>.</p>

<p>The database donnection URL <em>jdbc:default:connection</em> allows a Java method
to get the <em>Connection</em> of the SQL statement that called it. This is
the standard (SQL standard, Part 13, SQL Routines and Java) mechanism to obtain
the nested connection object. The method would get a <em>Connection</em>
as follows:</p>

<pre>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:default:connection");</pre>

<p>URL attributes are not supported as part of this connection URL. Any URL
attributes specified in a Properties object, user name, or password that are
passed to a <em>java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection()</em> call will be ignored.</p>

<p>Loading a JDBC driver in a database-side routine is not required.</p>
