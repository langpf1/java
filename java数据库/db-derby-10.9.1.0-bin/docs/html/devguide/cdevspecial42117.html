<h1 class="topictitle1">Programming database-side JDBC routines</h1>



<div><p>Methods invoked within an application are called application-side
methods. Methods invoked within <span>Derby</span> are
called database-side routines.</p>

<p>An application-side method can be exactly the same as a database-side routine.
The only difference is where you invoke them. You write the method only once.
Where you invoke the method--within the application or within an SQL statement--determines
whether it is an "application-side" or a "database-side" method. </p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevspecial29620.html">Database-side JDBC routines and nested connections</a></strong><br />
Most database-side JDBC routines need to share the same transaction space as the statements that called them.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevspecial16181.html">Database-side JDBC routines using non-nested connections</a></strong><br />
A database-side JDBC routine can create a new connection instead of using a nested connection. Statements executed in the routine will be part of a different transaction, and so can issue commits and rollbacks.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevspecial41728.html">Database-side JDBC routines and SQLExceptions</a></strong><br />
It is possible to code database-side routines, like application-side methods, to catch SQLExceptions. SQLExceptions that are caught within a routine are hidden from the calling application code.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevspecial45786.html">User-defined SQLExceptions</a></strong><br />
When the execution of a database-side method raises an error, Derby wraps that exception in an SQLException with an SQLState of 38000.</li>
