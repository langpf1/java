<h1 class="topictitle1">Measuring the cost of
<span>Derby</span>-style table
functions</h1>



<div><p>This topic shows how to measure the cost of a
<span>Derby</span>-style table
function.</p>


<p>
The following formula describes how to estimate the value returned
by  <em>VTICosting.getEstimatedCostPerInstantiation()</em>:
</p>


<p><strong>
C = I * A
</strong></p>


<p>where</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong> = The estimated <strong>C</strong>ost for creating and running the
        table function. That is, the value returned by
<em>VTICosting.getEstimatedCostPerInstantiation()</em>.
        In general, <strong>C</strong>ost is a measure of time in milliseconds.</li>

<li><strong>I</strong> = The  optimizer's <strong>I</strong>mprecision. A measure of how skewed the optimizer's estimates tend
        to be in your particular environment. See below for instructions on how to estimate this <strong>I</strong>mprecision.</li>

<li><strong>A</strong> = The <strong>A</strong>ctual time in milliseconds which it takes
        to create and run this table function.</li>

</ul>


<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Calculating the optimizer's imprecision</h2> 

<p>
We treat optimizer <strong>I</strong>mprecision as a constant across the
        runtime environment. The following formula describes it:
</p>


<p><strong>
I = O / T
</strong></p>


<p>where</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>O</strong> = The <strong>O</strong>ptimizer's estimated cost for a plan.</li>

<li><strong>T</strong> = The <strong>T</strong>otal runtime in milliseconds for the plan.</li>

</ul>


<p>
To estimate these values, turn on
<span>Derby</span> statistics collection
and run the following experiment several times, averaging the results:
</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Select</strong> = Select all of the rows from a big table.</li>

<li><strong>Record</strong> = In the statistics output, look for the ResultSet
          which represents the table scan. That scan has a field
          labelled "optimizer estimated cost". That's <strong>O</strong>. Now
          look for the fields in that ResultSet's statistics labelled
"constructor time", "open time", "next time", and "close time". Add up
          all of those fields. That total is <strong>T</strong>.
</li>

</ul>


<p>
For example:
</p>


<pre>
MAXIMUMDISPLAYWIDTH 7000;

CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS(1);
CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_STATISTICS_TIMING(1);

select * from T;

values SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS();
</pre>


</div>


<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Calculating the actual runtime cost of a table function</h2> 

<p>
The following formula explains how to compute the <strong>A</strong>ctual
        runtime cost for the table function:
</p>


<p><strong>
A =  ( P * N ) + E
</strong></p>


<p>where</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong> = The runtime spent <strong>P</strong>er row (in milliseconds).</li>

<li><strong>N</strong> = The <strong>N</strong>umber of rows in the table function.</li>

<li><strong>E</strong> = The time spent creating an <strong>E</strong>mpty instance of the
          table function which has no rows in it. Usually, <strong>P * N</strong> dwarfs
          <strong>E</strong>. That is, the table function instantiation cost is very
          small compared to the actual cost of looping through the
          rows. However, for some table functions, <strong>E</strong> may be significant
          and may dominate the table function's cost when <strong>N</strong> is small.</li>

</ul>


<p>
You may know that <strong>E</strong> is basically 0. If so, you can skip this step.
Otherwise, to estimate <strong>E</strong>, turn on
<span>Derby</span> statistics collection
and run the following experiment several times, averaging the results:
</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Short-circuit</strong> = Short-circuit the next() method of the
<em>ResultSet</em>
returned by your <span>Derby</span>-style
table function so that it returns
          <em>false</em> the first time it is called. This makes it
          appear that the
<em>ResultSet</em>
has no rows.
</li>

<li><strong>Select</strong> = Select all of the rows from the table function.</li>

<li><strong>Record</strong> = In the statistics output, look for the VTIResultSet
          which represents the table function scan. Add up
          the values of the fields in that VTIResultSet's statistics labelled
"constructor time", "open time", "next time", and "close time".
          That total is <strong>E</strong>.
</li>

</ul>


<p>
To estimate <strong>P</strong>, turn on
<span>Derby</span> statistics collection
and run the following experiment several times, averaging the results:
</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Select</strong> = Select all of the rows from the table function.</li>

<li><strong>Record</strong> = In the statistics output, look for the VTIResultSet
          which represents the table function scan. Add up
          the values of the fields in that VTIResultSet's statistics labelled
"constructor time", "open time", "next time", and "close
          time". Subtract <strong>E</strong> from the result. Now divide by the
          value of the field "Rows seen".
          The result is <strong>P</strong>.
</li>

</ul>


</div>


<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Computing the value returned by <em>getEstimatedCostPerInstantiation()</em></h2> 

<p>
Putting all of this together, the following formula describes the
        value returned by your
table function's
<em>VTICosting.getEstimatedCostPerInstantiation()</em>
method.
</p>


<p><strong>
C = O/T * [ ( P * N ) + E ]
