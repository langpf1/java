<h1 class="topictitle1">Writing restricted table functions</h1>



<div><p>Restricted table functions are
<span>Derby</span>-style table functions
which perform more efficiently because they can be told in advance which columns
they will be asked to fetch along with simple limits on those columns. This
feature exploits the expressiveness of the Java programming language and does
not require any extensions to SQL.
</p>

<p>A table function returns a rectangular chunk of data. If you use a restricted
table function, <span>Derby</span> can
tell the table function to return a shorter and  narrower rectangle.</p>

<p>
Consider the following scan of a table in a foreign database:</p>

<pre>    select id, firstName, lastName
    from table( foreignDatabaseEmployeeTable() ) s
    where lastName = 'Stone'
</pre>

<p>
If <em>foreignDatabaseEmployeeTable</em> is a restricted table function,
<span>Derby</span> can tell the table
function to fetch only the <em>id</em>, <em>firstName</em>, and <em>lastName</em>
columns. In addition, <span>Derby</span>
can tell the table function that it does not need to scan the entire
foreign table; instead, the table function only needs to retrieve information
for employees whose last name is "Stone".</p>

<p>
Depending on the table function and query, this feature can support 1000X, 
1000000X, or even greater performance improvements.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">How to use restricted table functions</h2>
<p>
Creating and using a restricted table function involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Implement</strong> - You must write a class which implements both
<em>java.sql.ResultSet</em> and the
<span>Derby</span>-specific interface
<em>org.apache.derby.vti.RestrictedVTI</em>. This interface defines an
<em>initScan()</em> method. When executing a query,
<span>Derby</span> uses that method to
tell the table function what columns it will have to fetch and what bounds
should be applied to those columns in order to reduce the number of rows
returned. For the rest of this discussion, this user-written class will be
referred to as <em>MyVTIClass</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Publish</strong> - You must publish the table function by creating a public
static method which returns a <em>MyVTIClass</em>. This is important. The
<span>Derby</span> compiler must be able
to see that the table function returns an object which implements both
<em>java.sql.ResultSet</em> and <em>org.apache.derby.vti.RestrictedVTI</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Declare</strong> - You declare the table function to
<span>Derby</span> using the same CREATE
FUNCTION syntax you are already familiar with. This syntax does not change.</li>

<li><strong>Invoke</strong> - You then use the table function in a query. When
<span>Derby</span> compiles the query, it
sees that the return type of the table function implements
<em>org.apache.derby.vti.RestrictedVTI</em>. Armed with this information, at
runtime <span>Derby</span> calls the
<em>initScan()</em> method once before calling any of the <em>ResultSet</em> methods.
</li>

</ol>

<p>For example, you would declare the function as follows:</p>

<pre>
public class MyVTIClass implements ResultSet, RestrictedVTI
{
    ...

    public void initScan(java.lang.String[] columnNames, 
        org.apache.derby.vti.Restriction restriction ) 
        throws SQLException {
         ... 
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Then you publish the table function method:</p>

<pre>
public static MyVTIClass foreignDatabaseEmployeeTable() 
    throws SQLException {
    ... 
}
</pre>

<p>Then you declare the table function to
<span>Derby</span>:</p>

<pre>
create function foreignDatabaseEmployeeTable()
returns table
(
    id int,
    birthday date,
    taxPayerID varchar( 50 ),
    firstName varchar( 50 ),
    lastName varchar( 50 )
)
language java
parameter style DERBY_JDBC_RESULT_SET
no sql
external name 'com.example.portal.ForeignQueries.foreignDatabaseEmployeeTable'
</pre>

<p>Finally, you invoke the table function in a query:</p>

<pre>
select id, firstName, lastName
from table( foreignDatabaseEmployeeTable() ) s
where lastName = 'Stone'
</pre>

<p>When you invoke this query,
<span>Derby</span> does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare</strong> - When
<span>Derby</span> prepares the query,
<span>Derby</span> sees that the
<em>foreignDatabaseEmployeeTable()</em> method returns an object which implements
<em>org.apache.derby.vti.RestrictedVTI</em>. This is all that
<span>Derby</span> needs to know in order
to compile a plan which takes advantage of this feature.</li>

<li><strong>Execute</strong> - When
<span>Derby</span> executes the query,
<span>Derby</span> calls
<em>initScan()</em>. In this example,
<span>Derby</span> calls
<em>initScan()</em> with the following arguments:
<pre>
initScan( new String[] { "ID", null, null, "FIRSTNAME", "LASTNAME" }, 
    new Restriction.ColumnQualifier(
        "LASTNAME", ORDER_OP_EQUALS, "Stone" ) )
</pre>

<p>This, in turn, causes the following to happen:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><em>Width</em> - The call to <em>initScan()</em> told the table function what
   columns should be fetched.</li>

  <li><em>Length</em> - The call to <em>initScan()</em> told the table function how
   to filter the rows it returns.</li>

  <li><em>Loop</em> - <span>Derby</span> then
   calls <em>MyVTIClass.next()</em> and retrieves rows until
   <em>MyVTIClass.next()</em> returns false. For each row,
   <span>Derby</span> calls:
     <ul>
     <li><em>MyVTIClass.getInt( 1 )</em> to get the <em>id</em> column.</li>

     <li><em>MyVTIClass.getString( 4 )</em> to get the <em>firstName</em>
      column.</li>

     <li><em>MyVTIClass.getString( 5 )</em> to get the <em>lastName</em>
      column.</li>

     </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

</li>

</ul>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Contract</h2>
<p><span>Derby</span> calls
<em>initScan()</em> before calling any other method on the <em>ResultSet</em>. The
call to <em>initScan()</em> merely passes hints, which the restricted table
function can exploit in order to perform better.
<span>Derby</span> enforces the
restriction outside the table function. Therefore, a restricted table function
can still fetch extra columns and can ignore part or all of the restriction set
by the call to <em>initScan()</em>.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Affected Operations</h2>
<p>Compared to ordinary table functions, a restricted table function can perform
better in queries involving the following comparisons of its columns to
constants:</p>

<pre>
&lt;
&lt;=
=
!=
&lt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;=
IS NULL
IS NOT NULL
</pre>

<p>In addition, performance gains can be realized for queries involving the
following operators on the columns of the restricted table function:</p>

<pre>
LIKE
BETWEEN
</pre>

<p>However, this feature does not boost performance either for the IN operator,
or in situations where <span>Derby</span>
transforms OR lists into IN lists. See "Or transformations" in
<span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span> for more information.</p>
