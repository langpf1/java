<h1 class="topictitle1">Upgrades</h1>



<div><p>To connect to a database created with a previous version of <span>Derby</span>, you must first upgrade
that database.</p>

<p>Upgrading involves writing changes to the system tables, so it is not possible
for databases on read-only media. The upgrade process:</p>

<ul>
<li>marks the database as upgraded to the current release (Version <span>10.9</span>).</li>

<li>allows use of new features.</li>

</ul>

<p>See the release notes for more information on upgrading your databases
to this version of <span>Derby</span>.</p>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="tdevpreupgrade.html">Preparing to upgrade</a></strong><br />
Upgrading your database occurs the first time the new Derby software connects to the old database.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="tdevupgradedb.html">Upgrading a database</a></strong><br />
To upgrade a database, you must explicitly request an upgrade the first time you connect to the database with the new version of Derby.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="tdevupgradesoft.html">Soft upgrade limitations</a></strong><br />
Soft upgrade allows you to run a newer version of Derby against an existing database without having to fully upgrade the database. This means that you can continue to run an older version of Derby against the database.</li>
