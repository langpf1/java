<div><p>In an embedded environment, typically there is only one database
per system and there are no administrative resources to protect databases.</p>

<div class="section">To configure security in an embedded environment:</div>

<ol>
<li><span>Encrypt the database when you create it.</span></li>

<li><span>Configure all security features as database-level properties. 
These properties are stored in the database (which is encrypted). See
<a href="cdevsetprop824451.html#cdevsetprop824451">Scope of properties</a> and 
<a href="cdevsetprop12821.html#cdevsetprop12821">Setting database-wide properties</a> for more
information.</span></li>

<li><span>Turn on protection for database-level properties so that they cannot
be overridden by system properties by setting the <em>derby.database.propertiesOnly</em> property
to TRUE. See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details
on this property.</span></li>

<li><span>To prevent unauthorized users from accessing databases once they
are booted, turn on user authentication and SQL authorization for the database.
Use NATIVE authentication or, alternatively, LDAP or a user-defined
class.</span></li>

</ol>
