example, you can protect these files and directories with operating system
permissions and firewalls.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Turn on user authentication for your system.  All users must provide
valid user IDs and passwords to access the 
<span>Derby</span> system. Use NATIVE

systems protect network connections with SSL/TLS.</div>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Configure SQL authorization for your databases.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Check and if necessary configure your Derby network security
