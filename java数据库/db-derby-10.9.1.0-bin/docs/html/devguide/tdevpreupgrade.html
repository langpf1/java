<div><p>Upgrading your database occurs the first time the new <span>Derby</span> software
connects to the old database.</p>

<div class="section"> <p>Before you connect to the database using the new software:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Back up your database to a safe location using <span>Derby</span> online/offline
backup procedures.</span> For more information on backup, see the <span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span>.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Update your CLASSPATH with the latest jar files.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Make sure that there are no older versions of the <span>Derby</span> jar
files in your CLASSPATH. You can determine if you have multiple versions of <span>Derby</span> in your CLASSPATH by using the sysinfo tool.</span>
 To use the <samp class="codeph">sysinfo</samp> tool,
execute the following command:<pre>java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo</pre>
The <samp class="codeph">sysinfo</samp> tool
uses information found in the <span>Derby</span> jar
files to determine the version of any <span>Derby</span> jar in your CLASSPATH. Be sure that you have only one version of
the <span>Derby</span> jar files specified
in your CLASSPATH.</li>
