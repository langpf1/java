<h1 class="topictitle1">Upgrading a database</h1>



<div><p>To upgrade a database, you must explicitly request an upgrade the
first time you connect to the database with the new version of <span>Derby</span>.</p>

<div class="p">Ensure that you <a href="tdevpreupgrade.html">complete the prerequisite
steps</a> before you upgrade:<ul>
<li>Back up your database before you upgrade.</li>

<li>Ensure that only the new <span>Derby</span> jar
files are in your CLASSPATH.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"> <div class="p">When you upgrade the database, you can perform a full upgrade
or soft upgrade:<ul>
<li>A full upgrade is a complete upgrade of the <span>Derby</span> database.
When you perform a full upgrade, you cannot connect to the database with an
older version of <span>Derby</span> and
you cannot revert back to the previous version. </li>

<li>A soft upgrade allows you to run a newer version of <span>Derby</span> against
an existing database without having to fully upgrade the database. This means
that you can continue to run an older version of <span>Derby</span> against
the database. However, if you perform a soft upgrade, certain features will
not be available to you until you perform a full upgrade.</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

to perform. The following table shows the upgrade types.</span>
