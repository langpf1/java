<h1 class="topictitle1">Soft upgrade limitations</h1>



<div><p>Soft upgrade allows you to run a newer version of <span>Derby</span> against
an existing database without having to fully upgrade the database. This means
that you can continue to run an older version of <span>Derby</span> against
the database.</p>

<div class="section"> <p>If you perform a soft upgrade, you will not be able to perform
certain functions that are not available in older versions of
<span>Derby</span>. Specifically, new
features that affect the structure of a database are not available with a soft
upgrade. For a list of the new features in a release, see the Release Notes for
that release.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>To perform a soft upgrade on a database created using an earlier version of
<span>Derby</span>, simply connect to the
database, as shown in the following example:</p>

<pre>connect 'jdbc:derby:sample'</pre>
