<h1 class="topictitle1">Introduction to Derby</h1>


<div><p>Welcome to <span>Derby</span>! <span>Derby</span> is a full-featured, open
source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is based on Java
technology and SQL.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> is written and
implemented completely in the Java programming language. <span>Derby</span> provides
users with a small-footprint standards-based database engine that can be tightly
embedded into any Java based solution. <span>Derby</span> ensures
data integrity and provides sophisticated transaction support. In the default
configuration there is no separate database server to be installed or maintained
by the end user.</p>

<p>
    The on-disk database format used by
    <span>Derby</span>
    is portable and platform-independent.
    You can move <span>Derby</span>
    databases from machine to machine without needing to
    modify the data.
    A <span>Derby</span>
    application can include a pre-built, populated database if
    it needs to, and that database will work in any
    <span>Derby</span>
    configuration.
</p>

<p>For more information about
<span>Derby</span>, visit the
<span>Derby</span> website at
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/" target="_blank">http://db.apache.org/derby</a>.
The website provides pointers to the
<span>Derby</span> Wiki and other
resources, such as the derby-users mailing list, where you can ask questions
about issues not covered in the documentation.</p>

<p>Before you install <span>Derby</span>,
you should understand the deployment options and system requirements.</p>
