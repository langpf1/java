<h1 class="topictitle1">Client/server environment</h1>



<div><p>A client/server environment is an environment in which multiple
applications connect to <span>Derby</span> over
the network.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> runs embedded in
a server framework that allows multiple network connections. (The framework
itself starts an instance of <span>Derby</span> and
runs in an embedded environment. However, the client applications do not run
in the embedded environment.)</p>

<p>You can also embed <span>Derby</span> in
any Java server framework. </p>

<p>See the <cite><span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite> for
more information on how to run <span>Derby</span> on
a server.</p>
