<h1 class="topictitle1">Using the <span>Derby</span> tools
and startup utilities</h1>



<div><p>There are several tools and utilities that you might want to use
as you begin to work with <span>Derby</span>. </p>

<p>The tools that are included with <span>Derby</span> are <samp class="codeph">dblook</samp>, <samp class="codeph">ij</samp>,
and <samp class="codeph">sysinfo</samp>. To run these tools see:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="tgsrunningsysinfo.html#tgsrunningsysinfo">Running sysinfo</a></li>

<li><a href="tgsrunningij.html#tgsrunningij">Running ij</a></li>

<li><a href="tgsrunningdblook.html#tgsrunningdblook">Running dblook</a></li>

</ul>

<p><span>Derby</span> includes a set
of scripts that you can use to start the <span>Derby</span> tools.
The scripts are located in the <span>DERBY_HOME</span><span class="filepath">/bin</span> directory.
When you run these scripts, your CLASSPATH environment variable is set if
you have not already set it, and remains set as long as you are running the
tool.</p>

<p>Most of the examples in this guide that show how to use the <span>Derby</span> scripts
to launch the <span>Derby</span> tools
assume that you are using the embedded mode of the <span>Derby</span> database
engine. Use the instructions below to run the scripts with the Network Server.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Running the scripts with the Network Server</h2><div class="p">To run
the scripts with the Network Server, use the following commands: <ul>
<li>For the <samp class="codeph">sysinfo</samp> tool, issue the command  <pre>NetworkServerControl sysinfo</pre>
</li>

<li>For the <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> tool, issue the command  <pre>set DERBY_OPTS=-Dij.protocol=jdbc:derby://localhost/</pre>
 and
then start <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> by issuing the command <samp class="codeph">ij</samp>.</li>

<li>For the <samp class="codeph">dblook</samp> tool, call the script and specify the <samp class="codeph">-d</samp> option
and the full connection URL to the Network Server database. For  example: <pre>dblook -d 'jdbc:derby://localhost/myDB;user=usr'</pre>
 </li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Additional <span>Derby</span> utilities</h2><p>In
addition, there are Derby utilities that are system procedures that you can
call by using the <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> tool. For example, there are system
procedures that you can use to import and export external files. Instructions
on how to use these system procedures are included in the 
<span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span> and the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>
