<h1 class="topictitle1">Tutorial overview</h1>



<div><p>Each activity in this self-study tutorial highlights an important
feature of  <span>Derby</span>. </p>

<p>Here is what you can expect to learn in each activity:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Activity 1:</dt>

<dd>Use the  <span>Derby</span> <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> tool
to load the <span>Derby</span> embedded
driver and start the  <span>Derby</span> database
engine.  Create the database <samp class="codeph">firstdb</samp> and the table <samp class="codeph">FIRSTTABLE</samp>.
Use a few basic SQL statements to insert and select data. The <span>Derby</span> message
log <samp class="codeph">derby.log</samp> and the database directories and files are
introduced.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Activity 2:</dt>

<dd>Use <span>Derby</span> within a client/server
configuration. Start the <span>Derby</span> Network
Server, which will embed the <span>Derby</span> engine.
 In a separate process, use the <span>Derby</span> <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> 
tool to load the <span>Derby</span> client
driver and connect to the Network Server. Create a database called  <samp class="codeph">seconddb</samp> and
the table <samp class="codeph">SECONDTABLE</samp>. Use a few  basic SQL statements to
insert and select data.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Activity 3:</dt>

<dd>Load the <span>Derby</span> database
engine from a simple Java JDBC program. Use the embedded driver to create
the database <samp class="codeph">jdbcDemoDB</samp> and the <samp class="codeph">WISH_LIST</samp> table.
 Populate the table with text entered from the keyboard, then view a list
of the records in the table. Walk through the code to understand the basic
structure  of a JDBC program that accesses a <span>Derby</span> database.
The <samp class="codeph">CLASSPATH</samp> variable and connection URL attribute <samp class="codeph">;shutdown=true</samp> are
introduced.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Activity 4:</dt>

<dd>Modify the Java JDBC program to load the client driver and connect to
the <span>Derby</span> Network Server.
 Compile the altered program and test that the program operates as it did
in the previous activity.</dd>
