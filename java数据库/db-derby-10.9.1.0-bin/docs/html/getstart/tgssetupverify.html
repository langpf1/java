<h1 class="topictitle1">Verifying the Derby system configuration</h1>



<div><p>You should confirm that your computer has the correct software
installed and that the environment variables are set before you start working
with <span>Derby</span>.</p>

<div class="section"> <p>To check the <span>Derby</span> system
configuration:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Verify that the <samp class="codeph">java</samp> executable file, version 1.4.2 or,
higher is in your command execution PATH by opening a command window and running
the <samp class="codeph">java -version</samp> command.</span> The output from
the command looks something like this:
<pre><tt class="sysout">java version "1.6.0_24"  
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b07)  
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 19.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)</tt></pre>

The
output you see might be different from what is shown here because the <samp class="codeph">java
-version</samp> command outputs vendor-specific information. If the command
produces an error or the version listed is not 1.4 or higher, install a JDK
before continuing.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Verify that the  <span>DERBY_HOME</span> 
environment variable is set and points to the root directory of the  <span>Derby</span> <span>10.9</span>  installation. Open
a command window and run the appropriate command for your system. </span> If
you installed <span>Derby</span> in
the /opt/<span>Derby_10</span> directory
on UNIX or the c:\<span>Derby_10</span> directory
on Windows, the command that you use and the expected output are shown in
the following table.

 If you receive an error or do not see the expected

variable, as described in <a href="tgssetupjavaenvir.html#tgssetupjavaenvir">Setting the environment variables</a>.
