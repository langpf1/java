<h1 class="topictitle1">upgrade=true attribute</h1>


<div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Function</h2>
<p>Upgrades a database that was created using an earlier version of
<span>Derby</span> to the current version
of <span>Derby</span>, then connects to
it. If the database does not exist, an error appears in the error log and the
connection attempt fails with an <em>SQLException</em> indicating that the
database cannot be found.</p>

<p>This operation performs a full upgrade, as defined in "Upgrading a database"
in the <span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span>. For more information
about upgrades, see the other topics under "Upgrades" in the
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span>.</p>

<p>For a database for which authentication and SQL authorization are both
enabled, only the <a href="rrefattrib26867.html#rrefattrib26867">database
owner</a> can perform a full upgrade. See also "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot perform a full upgrade on a database already booted
    in soft upgrade mode. If a database is already booted in soft upgrade mode,
    the <em>upgrade=true</em> attribute will have no effect.
    If a database is already booted in soft upgrade mode,
    you can first shutdown the database with the
    <em><a href="rrefattrib16471.html#rrefattrib16471">shutdown=true</a></em>
    attribute and then connect with <em>upgrade=true</em> to perform the upgrade. 
</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Combining with other attributes</h2>
<p>You must specify a <em>databaseName</em> (after the subprotocol in the
database connection URL) or a
<em><a href="rrefattrib17246.html#rrefattrib17246">databaseName=nameofDatabase</a></em>
attribute with this attribute.</p>

<p>You cannot combine this attribute with the
<em><a href="rrefattribcollation.html#rrefattribcollation">collation</a></em>
or <em><a href="rrefattrib56769.html#rrefattrib56769">territory=ll_CC</a></em>
attributes.</p>
