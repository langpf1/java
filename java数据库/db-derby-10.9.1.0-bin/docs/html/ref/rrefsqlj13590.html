<h1 class="topictitle1">CONSTRAINT clause</h1>


<div>
<div class="section"> <p>A CONSTRAINT clause is an optional part of a <a href="rrefsqlj24513.html#rrefsqlj24513">CREATE TABLE statement</a> or <a href="rrefsqlj81859.html#rrefsqlj81859">ALTER TABLE statement</a>. A constraint is a rule to which data
must conform. Constraint names are optional.</p>
 <div class="p">A CONSTRAINT can be one
of the following:   <ul>
<li>a
column-level constraint   <p>Column-level constraints refer to a single column
in the table and do not specify a column name (except check constraints).
They refer to the column that they follow.</p>
</li>

<li>a
table-level constraint   <p>Table-level constraints refer to one or more columns
in the table. Table-level constraints specify the names of the columns to
which they apply. Table-level CHECK constraints can refer to 0 or more columns
in the table.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
 <div class="p">Column
constraints include:   <ul>
<li>NOT NULL   <p>Specifies that this column cannot hold NULL values (constraints
of this type are not nameable).</p>
</li>

<li>PRIMARY KEY 
 <p>Specifies the column that uniquely identifies a row in the table. The
identified columns must be defined as NOT NULL. </p>
 <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>If you attempt
to add a primary key using ALTER TABLE and any of the columns included in
the primary key contain null values, an error will be generated and the primary
key will not be added. See <a href="rrefsqlj81859.html#rrefsqlj81859">ALTER TABLE statement</a> for
more information.</div>
</li>

<li>UNIQUE   <p>Specifies that values in the column must be unique.</p>
</li>

<li>FOREIGN KEY   <p>Specifies that the values in the column must correspond
to values in a referenced primary key or unique key column or that they are
NULL.</p>
</li>

<li>CHECK   <p>Specifies rules for values in the column.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
 <div class="p">Table constraints include:   <ul>
<li>PRIMARY KEY <p>Specifies
the column or columns that uniquely identify a row in the table. NULL values
are not allowed.</p>
</li>

<li>UNIQUE   <p>Specifies that values in the columns must be unique.</p>
</li>

<li>FOREIGN KEY   <p>Specifies that the values in the columns must correspond

 <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>If
the foreign key consists of multiple columns, and <em>any</em> column is NULL,
the whole key is considered NULL. The insert is permitted no matter what is

<li>CHECK   <p>Specifies a wide range of rules for values in the table.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
 <p>Column constraints and table constraints
have the same function; the difference is in where you specify them. Table
constraints allow you to specify more than one column in a PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE,
CHECK, or FOREIGN KEY constraint definition. Column-level constraints (except
for check constraints) refer to only one column.</p>

<p>A constraint operates with the privileges of the owner of the constraint.
See "Using SQL standard authorization" and "Privileges on views, triggers, and
constraints" in the <span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span> for
details.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Syntax</h2> </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Primary key constraints</h2> <p>A primary
key defines the set of columns that uniquely identifies rows in a table.</p>
 <p>When
you create a primary key constraint, none of the columns included in the primary
key can have NULL constraints; that is, they must not permit NULL values.</p>
 <p>ALTER
TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY allows you to include existing columns in a primary
key if they were first defined as NOT NULL. NULL values are not allowed. If
the column(s) contain NULL values, the system will not add the primary key
constraint. See <a href="rrefsqlj81859.html#rrefsqlj81859">ALTER TABLE statement</a> for more information.</p>
 <p>A
table can have at most one PRIMARY KEY constraint.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Unique constraints</h2><p>
A UNIQUE constraint defines a set of columns that uniquely identify rows in a
table only if all the key values are not NULL. If one or more key parts are
NULL, duplicate keys are allowed. </p>

<p>For example, if there is a UNIQUE constraint on <samp class="codeph">col1</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">col2</samp> of a table, the combination of the values held by
<samp class="codeph">col1</samp> and <samp class="codeph">col2</samp> will be unique as long
as these values are not NULL. If one of <samp class="codeph">col1</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">col2</samp> holds a NULL value, there can be another identical row in
the table.</p>

<p>A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Foreign key constraints</h2> <p>Foreign keys provide
a way to enforce the referential integrity of a database. A foreign key is
a column or group of columns within a table that references a key in some
other table (or sometimes, though rarely, the same table). The foreign key
must always include the columns of which the types exactly match those in
the referenced primary key or unique constraint.</p>
 <p>For a table-level
foreign key constraint in which you specify the columns in the table that
make up the constraint, you cannot use the same column more than once.</p>
 <p>If
there is a column list in the <em>ReferencesSpecification </em>(a list of columns
in the referenced table), it must correspond either to a unique constraint
or to a primary key constraint in the referenced table. The <em>ReferencesSpecification</em> can
omit the column list for the referenced table if that table has a declared
primary key.</p>
 <p>If there is no column list in the <em>ReferencesSpecification </em>and
the referenced table has no primary key, a statement exception is thrown.
(This means that if the referenced table has only unique keys, you must include
a column list in the <em>ReferencesSpecification.</em>)</p>
 <div class="p">A foreign key
constraint is satisfied if there is a matching value in the referenced unique
or primary key column. If the foreign key consists of multiple columns, the
foreign key value is considered NULL if any of its columns contains a NULL.
  <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>It is possible for a foreign key consisting of multiple columns to
allow one of the columns to contain a value for which there is no matching
value in the referenced columns, per the SQL-92 standard. To avoid this situation,
create NOT NULL constraints on all of the foreign key's columns.</div>
</div>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Foreign key constraints and DML</h2> <p>When you insert
into or update a table with an enabled foreign key constraint, <span>Derby</span> checks
that the row does not violate the foreign key constraint by looking up the
corresponding referenced key in the referenced table. If the constraint is
not satisfied, <span>Derby</span> rejects
the insert or update with a statement exception.</p>
 <p>When you update or
delete a row in a table with a referenced key (a primary or unique constraint
referenced by a foreign key), <span>Derby</span> checks
every foreign key constraint that references the key to make sure that the
removal or modification of the row does not cause a constraint violation.
If removal or modification of the row would cause a constraint violation,
the update or delete is not permitted and <span>Derby</span> throws
a statement exception.</p>
 <p><span>Derby</span> performs
constraint checks at the time the statement is executed, not when the transaction
commits.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Backing indexes</h2> <p>UNIQUE,
PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY constraints generate indexes that enforce or
"back" the constraint (and are sometimes called <em>backing indexes</em>).
PRIMARY KEY constraints generate unique indexes. FOREIGN KEY constraints
generate non-unique indexes. UNIQUE constraints generate unique indexes if
all the columns are non-nullable, and they generate non-unique indexes if
one or more columns are nullable. Therefore, if a column or set of columns has
a UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, or FOREIGN KEY constraint on it, you do not need to
create an index on those columns for performance. <span>Derby</span> has
already created it for you. See <a href="rrefsqlj20937.html#rrefsqlj20937__sqlj27363">Indexes and constraints</a>.</p>

<p>These indexes are
available to the optimizer for query optimization (see <a href="rrefsqlj20937.html#rrefsqlj20937">CREATE INDEX statement</a>)
and have system-generated names.</p>
 <p>You cannot drop backing indexes with
a DROP INDEX statement; you must drop the constraint or the table.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Check constraints</h2> <p>A
check constraint can be used to specify a wide range of rules for the contents
of a table. A search condition (which is a boolean expression) is specified
for a check constraint. This search condition must be satisfied for all rows
in the table. The search condition is applied to each row that is modified
on an INSERT or UPDATE at the time of the row modification. The entire statement
is aborted if any check constraint is violated.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section" id="rrefsqlj13590__sqlj57077"><a name="rrefsqlj13590__sqlj57077"><!-- --></a><h2 class="sectiontitle">Requirements for search condition</h2> <p>If
a check constraint is specified as part of a column-definition, a column reference
can only be made to the same column. Check constraints specified as part of
a table definition can have column references identifying columns previously
defined in the CREATE TABLE statement.</p>
 <div class="p">The search condition must always
return the same value if applied to the same values. Thus, it cannot contain
any of the following:   <ul>
<li>Dynamic parameters (?)</li>

<li>Date/Time Functions (CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)</li>

<li>Subqueries</li>

<li>User Functions (such as USER, SESSION_USER, CURRENT_USER)</li>

</ul>
</div>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Referential actions</h2> <p>You can specify
an ON DELETE clause and/or an ON UPDATE clause, followed by the appropriate
action (CASCADE, RESTRICT, SET NULL, or NO ACTION) when defining foreign keys.
These clauses specify whether <span>Derby</span> should
modify corresponding foreign key values or disallow the operation, to keep
foreign key relationships intact when a primary key value is updated or deleted
from a table.</p>
 <p>You specify the update and delete rule of a referential
constraint when you define the referential constraint.</p>
 <p>The update rule
applies when a row of either the parent or dependent table is updated. The
choices are NO ACTION and RESTRICT. </p>
 <p>When a value in a column of the
parent table's primary key is updated and the update rule has been specified
as RESTRICT, <span>Derby</span> checks
dependent tables for foreign key constraints. If any row in a dependent table
violates a foreign key constraint, the transaction is rolled back. </p>
 <p>If
the update rule is NO ACTION, <span>Derby</span> checks
the dependent tables for foreign key constraints <em>after</em> all updates
have been executed but <em>before</em> triggers have been executed. If any row
in a dependent table violates a foreign key constraint, the statement is rejected.</p>
 <p>When
a value in a column of the dependent table is updated, and that value is part
of a foreign key, NO ACTION is the implicit update rule. NO ACTION means that
if a foreign key is updated with a non-null value, the update value must match
a value in the parent table's primary key when the update statement is completed.
If the update does not match a value in the parent table's primary key, the
statement is rejected.</p>
 <p>The delete rule applies when a row of the parent
table is deleted and that row has dependents in the dependent table of the
referential constraint. If rows of the dependent table are deleted, the delete
operation on the parent table is said to be <em>propagated</em> to the dependent
table. If the dependent table is also a parent table, the action specified
applies, in turn, to its dependents. </p>
 <p>The choices are NO ACTION, RESTRICT,
CASCADE, or SET NULL. SET NULL can be specified only if some column of the
foreign key allows null values.</p>
 <p>If the delete rule is:</p>
 <p>NO ACTION, <span>Derby</span> checks the dependent
tables for foreign key constraints <em>after</em> all deletes have been executed
but <em>before</em> triggers have been executed. If any row in a dependent table
violates a foreign key constraint, the statement is rejected.</p>
 <p>RESTRICT, <span>Derby</span> checks dependent tables
for foreign key constraints. If any row in a dependent table violates a foreign
key constraint, the transaction is rolled back.</p>
 <p>CASCADE, the delete
operation is propagated to the dependent table (and that table's dependents,
if applicable).</p>
 <p>SET NULL, each nullable column of the dependent table's
foreign key is set to null. (Again, if the dependent table also has dependent
tables, nullable columns in those tables' foreign keys are also set to null.)</p>
 <p>Each
referential constraint in which a table is a parent has its own delete rule;
all applicable delete rules are used to determine the result of a delete operation.
Thus, a row cannot be deleted if it has dependents in a referential constraint
with a delete rule of RESTRICT or NO ACTION. Similarly, a row cannot be deleted
if the deletion cascades to any of its descendants that are dependents in
a referential constraint with the delete rule of RESTRICT or NO ACTION. </p>
 <div class="p">Deleting
a row from the parent table involves other tables. Any table involved in a
delete operation on the parent table is said to be delete-connected to the
parent table. The delete can affect rows of these tables in the following
ways:   <ul>
<li>If the delete rule is RESTRICT or NO ACTION, a dependent table is involved
in the operation but is not affected by the operation. (That is, <span>Derby</span> checks
the values within the table, but does not delete any values.) </li>

<li>If the delete rule is SET NULL, a dependent table's rows can be updated
when a row of the parent table is the object of a delete or propagated delete
operation. </li>

<li>If the delete rule is CASCADE, a dependent table's rows can be deleted
when a parent table is the object of a delete. </li>

<li>If the dependent table is also a parent table, the actions described in
this list apply, in turn, to its dependents.</li>

</ul>
