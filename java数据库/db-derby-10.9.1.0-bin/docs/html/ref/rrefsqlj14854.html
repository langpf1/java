<h1 class="topictitle1">HAVING clause</h1>

<div>
<div class="section">
<p>A HAVING clause restricts the results of a GROUP BY in a <em><a href="rrefselectexpression.html#rrefselectexpression">SelectExpression</a>.</em> The HAVING clause is applied
to each group of the grouped table, much as a WHERE clause is applied to a
select list. If there is no GROUP BY clause, the HAVING clause is applied
to the entire result as a single group. The SELECT clause cannot refer directly
to any column that does not have a GROUP BY clause. It can, however, refer
to constants, aggregates, and special registers.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Syntax</h2>
<pre><strong>HAVING <em>searchCondition</em></strong></pre>

<div class="p">The <em>searchCondition</em>, which is a specialized <em>booleanExpression</em>, can contain only grouping columns (see <a href="rrefsqlj32654.html#rrefsqlj32654">GROUP BY clause</a>), columns that are part of aggregate expressions,
and columns that are part of a subquery. For example, the following query
is illegal, because the column SALARY is not a grouping column, it does not
appear within an aggregate, and it is not within a subquery:
<pre><strong>-- SELECT COUNT(*)
-- FROM SAMP.STAFF
-- GROUP BY ID
-- HAVING SALARY &gt; 15000</strong></pre>
</div>

<p>Aggregates in the HAVING clause do not need to appear in the SELECT list.
If the HAVING clause contains a subquery, the subquery can refer to the outer
query block if and only if it refers to a grouping column.</p>

</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2>
<pre><strong><span>-- Find the total number of economy seats taken on a flight,
-- grouped by airline,
-- only when the group has at least 2 records. </span>
SELECT SUM(ECONOMY_SEATS_TAKEN), AIRLINE_FULL
FROM FLIGHTAVAILABILITY, AIRLINES
WHERE SUBSTR(FLIGHTAVAILABILITY.FLIGHT_ID, 1, 2) = AIRLINE
GROUP BY AIRLINE_FULL
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1
