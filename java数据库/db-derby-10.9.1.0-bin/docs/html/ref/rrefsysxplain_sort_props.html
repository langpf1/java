<h1 class="topictitle1">SYSXPLAIN_SORT_PROPS system table</h1>



<div><p>The SYSXPLAIN_SORT_PROPS table captures information about row sorting
actions which occurred during statements that were executed using
RUNTIMESTATISTICS with XPLAIN style.</p>

    <div class="section"><p>See "Working with RunTimeStatistics" in
         <span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span> for information
         on how to configure this.</p>

<p>Rows in this table are typically joined with rows in
            SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS and SYSXPLAIN_RESULTSETS during analysis.</p>

<pre>select s.stmt_text, rs.op_identifier, 
       srt.no_input_rows, srt.no_output_rows
    from my_stats.sysxplain_sort_props srt,
         my_stats.sysxplain_resultsets rs,
         my_stats.sysxplain_statements s
    where rs.stmt_id = s.stmt_id and rs.sort_rs_id = srt.sort_rs_id</pre>

            <p>Rows in this table are added
                automatically when
                <span>Derby</span>
                has been configured appropriately. The
          rows remain in the table until you delete them or drop the table.</p>

<p>The following table shows the contents of the SYSXPLAIN_SORT_PROPS system
table.</p>
